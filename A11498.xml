            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For ſeing the ſame argument hath ben hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led long ſince, and of late; learnedly, and at large by men of our ownes: what neede this foraine ayde? In ſuch aboundance of wits and writings, to tranſport <hi>Sarauia</hi> out of Latine into Engliſh, is to bring owles to Athens, and to carry ſtickes to the wood; as it is in the Prouerbe.</p>
            <p>True it is: the cauſe hath ben vndertaken long ſince; but it was late firſt: and of late; but it was long firſt: And the ſame hath ben maintayned learnedly enough; if not with learning too much: and it hath ben handled at large alſo; yet all little enough: Such is the female miſconceit, of the laſciuious male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and the male miſcontent of the learned ignoraunt of this age, <hi>euer learning and neuer able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Notwithſtanding, ſeeing in the iudgement of the moſt wiſe and beſt learned, this <hi>Germane</hi> Booke ſeemed for ſound iudgement inferiour to none, and for graue diſcourſe equall to any, it was therfore thought by them an action no leſſe commodious to the people, then commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to the Author; that he, who in the cauſes of preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, hath propounded his iudgement vnto all, ſhoulde haue his iudgement expounded vnto vs. The which although it hath beene curſtly cenſured by a certaine ſuſpicious and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Criticke, emulous of his betters credite, who in his profeſſed lectures hath vſed the remembraunce of his name in diſdaine, with <hi>Sarauia neſcio quis:</hi> Yet his beſt auditors there, and others his betters elſewhere, haue found this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene <hi>Sarauia</hi> and him: that, beſides his great learning, and no leſſe experience (of the which this great Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor neuer had the one, neuer will haue the other) <hi>Sarauia</hi> hath made knowen to him and the whole world, by this his

I doe not know.</p>
            <p>I, but now we ſee the aduerſe part (partly by theyr lawleſſe outrage, and partly by theyr lawfull reſtraint) to be nowe as impotent in their faction, as they are odious in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be at this time as vnable, as they were at all times vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to preuaile: and then, what neede we any longer ſtriue when the ennemy can no longer ſtand? I aunſwer; that their increaſe was ſeene long ſince, to be at the full, and their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite appeareth euen now to be in the Waine. For the which as we are to giue God thankes, (who in taking Iuſtice vpon ſome of them, hath taken pitty vpon the whole Church,) ſo likewiſe are we to pray for the reſt, that in good time we may ſee, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theyr ſpeedy amendement, or their preſent preferment: (For it is time (O Lord) that thou haue mercy vppon Sion, yea the time is come.) Notwithſtanding, in the meane time wee haue entertained this profered aide, not ſo much to inuade the ſeditious brethren, or to bring home the reſolued recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, as to ſtrengthen the godly Subiect, and to bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the well affected Proteſtant.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He auncient receiued cuſtome of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating books to men of name and authority, is growne and grounded vppon many reaſons great &amp; waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all which it ſhalbe needeleſſe for me to reuiſe in this place: But for my part, there are chiefly three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes mouing me to conſecrat this my ſmall trauell to you the moſt Honorable, and honored of me (my good Lordes.) Firſt, that thereby I might teſtifye vnto you the duety and deuotion of a loyall and gratefull minde towards you, that find my ſelfe ſeuerally and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly bound vnto you all and euery one of you. For firſt, one of you (vppon my repaire into England) diſdained not to entertaine me a ſtranger with no ſtraunge countenance, and ſtraunge courteſie: The other alſo dained to accept me (vnworthy) into his owne family: And the other of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall fauour brought to paſſe, that by her Maieſties pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge and preferment, I might be made of a forreiner a freeman, of an alien a Cittizen. And ſeeing I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:8306:6"/> all theſe fauours without any deede or deſert of mine, (God thou knoweſt mine vnworthines) I were but too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate and vnkinde, if I ſhould bury in darke and deepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence your ſo rare and religious demerites. But whereas I haue no other thing to render or repay vnto your Honors, but a mine of thanks, and a thankfull minde, that mind wil I alwaies beare, and that duety in minde, ſo that I will not ceaſe to worſhip the ſacred memory of your religious loue towardes me.</p>
            <p>Another cauſe is, the very nature of the argumente I vndertake, the which I could not well proſecute, without ſome particular mention of the Church of England. In the which, ſeeing I haue now my part and portion of a paſtoral prouince (and praiſed be the Lord, my lotte is fallen vnto me in a faire ground) might I not ſeeme vnmindfull of my good &amp; neglecting my duty, if when I vndertake the cauſe of thoſe Churches which are alien and outlandiſh, I ſhould ouerſlip the ſtate of mine own Church now gremiall to me and mere Engliſh? But when mine hearts deſire and praier to God is, that I may ſome waies benefite my countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if I forget thee O Ieruſalem? And yet if I ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my duety herein, the meere alliance and relation of the matters them ſelues, is ſuch and ſo great, as that by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of neceſſary conſequence I muſt be inforced, to inferre and praefer the mention thereof in my bookes. But becauſe I am but new made of Flemiſh, ſterling, that is, of Outlandiſh, Engliſh, it may be happely, that they which are home-bred, will thinke I deale not wel with them, to deale with them, and that I meddle too farre, when I come ſo neare. For which cauſe I thought it neceſſarye for mee, to commend and commit my ſelfe vnto your Honorable patrocinie, that this ſtranger book might freely paſſe vnder your ſafe conduct. Neither ſhall it grieue me much, though it be vniuſtly caſt by moſt voices, if it may iuſtly paſſe your accoumpt: neither ſhall it hurt me much, though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged multitude in diſordered throngs caſt ſtones at mee, only if your Honors vouchſafe to giue me the white ſtone.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:8306:6"/>
            <p>But the laſt cauſe is, for that I am in ſome doubt, how this diſcourſe will be taken of them, for whoſe ſakes eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it was vndertaken. For it is to be feared, that they are ſo far from turning ſtones vnto bread, that they will make ſtones of bread, and that which I haue done to relieue their weakenes, they will account as deuiſed to vndermine their eſtate, and ſo take that with the left hand, which I proffer with the right. And in deede what other thing ſhoulde I looke for at their hands, who (in lieu of my well deſeruing towards them) haue ſought heretofore, rather to caſt me off with diſgrace, then to giue me vp with reward? How de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous I haue alwaies beene of publique peace, and howe zealous ouer them that layd ſnares for my life, I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale vnto God and men: and yet for my good will what great reward haue I receiued at their handes, but ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, or what better meede for my paines, then bitter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice?</p>
            <p>But no reaſon I ſhould take this kinde of cruelty vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing it is ſo common a caſe, and commonly incident to me, with many my betters. And therefore far be it from me, that the iniuries of a few (though no fewe iniuries) ſhould ſo far preuaile with me, that I ſhould therefore leſſe regard the better health of the whole Church. Should I be for priuate wronges ſo far inraged beyond all ſence, and beſides my ſelfe, as to ſtudy to bee reuenged vppon many good men, being offended but of a few bad fellowes.</p>
            <p>After I was laſt called fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence by the Belgike Churches, I conuerſed among them in diuers places ten whole yeares together: in what time I found by aduiſed experience, that there were two thinges of great moment greatly miſſed in thoſe Churches, the which I could not then without grief, and cannot now without ſin conceale, namely, <hi>That the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the Goſpell receiued of them by publike authority, is not adorned by them with due honor:</hi> And againe, <hi>That wealth and worſhippe in the order of the miniſtery, is thought a needleſſe thing to aduaunce the eſtimation thereof in a ciuill ſociety.</hi> (Men that we are) miſconceauing is the cauſe of all this. For now a
<pb facs="tcp:8306:7"/> daies (for ſooth) no Church is thought reformed, vnleſſe <hi>Firſt all Church dignities, be either thrust out at the Church porch, or thruſt downe to the belfry,</hi> and then <hi>all the Church goods, be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put in the great bagge, or giuen to the greedy baggage.</hi> The which errour if it doe proceed (as it will if it be not nipt in the head) it will one day reuele, not only vpon the church, but alſo vppon the whole ſtate a greater miſery, then can eaſely be driuen into euery common mans head. To the which this alſo may be added, that there are many of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (and they are of many opinions) <hi>That the aboliſhing of Biſhops is not the leaſt part of reformation,</hi> and <hi>That their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church is crept in, not of any diuine inſtitution of Gods word, but</hi> (that which not any Church before this time did euer auouch) <hi>of the onely errour and ambition of mans wit.</hi> Our elders &amp; all auncient diuines (for the preuenting of Sciſme, and conuenting the head-ſtrong and giddy headed raſhnes of many) helde the prudent moderation of one (in one Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or prouince) to be ordained from aboue. And they knew very well, that albeit the quirke of ſpeaking (for ſo they ſpeak) be found in many, yet the art of gouerning, and the rule of well ruling, is knowen but of a few.</p>
            <p>How great a ſtay a godly and prudent Biſhop may bee, to any troubled or diſtreſſed State, auncient hiſtories doe plainly teach, &amp; preſent experience might make vs learne. Doe you not knowe (I know you are not ignorant) howe that many times, many things betide in a chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, which require the aduiſe of Eccleſiaſtical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates? As alſo where the Goſpell is publiquely authoriſed, that there are many thinges requiſite for the Church, which cannot be effected with out the ciuill Magiſtrate? And how then, are not they in a peeuiſh and a peruerſe errour, which either exclude the Magiſtrate from cauſes Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke, or ſequeſter the Miniſter from affaires politike? (ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men that they are) as if either the Chriſtian Magiſtrate were no part of the Church, or the ſacred Miniſter not Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of the ſame common wealth? And yet neither the Magiſtrate (if he be Chriſtian) is to neglect the ſafety of the
<pb facs="tcp:8306:7"/> Church, nor the Miniſter (if he be godly) not to regard the ſafegard of the ſtate. But theſe two (the Magiſtrate and the Miniſter) ſo long as they ſhalbe diſtracted into partes, and as it were diuorſed in ſtate the one from the other, and ſhall not take ſweete counſell together like friends, or not communicate in conſent for their common benefite, they cannot but conceiue diuers and doubtfull ſurmiſes, fonde yea, and ſome times falſe opinions of each others gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Magiſtrate that keepeth freſh in memory the new broken yoke of the Popes tiranny, feareth leaſt by any meanes he ſhould fall againe into the like, though vnlike. And therfore is iealous ouer the counſels and conuenticles of the Cleargy, &amp; ſuſpecteth alwaies ſome ſnare to be laid in them to entangle his liberty. Of the other ſide, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors (ſo many as are, or will bee accoumpted faithfull in their Miniſtery) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but be careful for the welfare of their flocke, and therefore ſeeke by all meanes to benefite the Church, and to ſhun thoſe things which may preiudice the ſame: who when they ſee diuers kindes of people to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in the Common-wealth, and they ſome of them open profeſſed enemies to the Church, ſome but ſuſpicious and ſuſpected fauorites, few faithfull and vnfeined friendes; no woonder though they dare hardly commit their cauſe and their credites, them ſelues and their ſafeties, to ſuch Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. Beſides, they being ignorant of the common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, how ſhould they bee good interpreters of ſuch thinges as are done in the Common-wealth? neither can ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels be well communicated to the common people, and yet reaſon would they ſhould, ſeeing they are common.</p>
            <p>If the States in the Low-countries (brought to lowe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate) had their learned and reuerend Biſhoppes, in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation they ought to be, in euerie well ordered ſtate, no doubt with their vigilancye and moderation, they might more eaſily haue remedied their preſent miſeries. I did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine (not without cauſe,) to ſee the Church goods pilde and pilferd, and learned Paſtors ſet to their ſtipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: Of the which, ſome in deed do liue &amp; releeue their families (though
<pb facs="tcp:8306:8"/> porely God knowes) and ſome againe for the moity of their ſtipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; the multitude of their familiars, are by no means able to keepe open ſhop windowes. I ſpeake not, (or neede not) of them which are denied their wages, or ſerue (like our ſoldiers) for cheeſe flemiſh, if that they can get it. But by this meanes, when as (to the griefe of al good men) I did ſee the moſt ſacred ſtudie of Diuinity to languiſhe, that young wits were affraid of it, and old heads a weary of it, Churches without Paſtors, Schooles wanting profeſſors: I lamented with my ſelfe, and ſorrowed for theſe miſchiefes, and thoſe wee might eaſily coniect, would iſſue out of theſe as out of Pandoraes box. Neither did I ſorrowe for theſe thinges to my ſelfe alone: I acquainted my griefs, where I was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But becauſe in thoſe intempeſtuous times, I could not ſafelie either ſpeake, or write my minde, without ſuſpect of contention, couetouſnes, or ambition, I conteined my ſelfe diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, expecting a fitter opportunity. In the mean while, I could haue wiſhed that this argument might haue bin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken of ſome other, and of ſome other profeſsion: And that doubtleſſe might haue bene performed of ſuch an one with ſo much the more eaſe and leſſe enuie, by howe muche the matter did leſſe concerne himſelfe. But ſeeing no man offered himſelfe to this ſeruice, (and the ſeruice honorable) after manye delaies, I ouercame my ſelfe at laſt, and in the zeale of my dutie, haue vndergon that burthen, which <hi>Atlas</hi> himſelfe can not ſuſtaine alone: and therefore in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mine owne weaknes, I come loaden to your Honors with mine ouer-burden, and laye downe the ſame in three little bookes vnder your names (thriſe reuerend and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.) And this alſo haue I done with the greater confidence, and the leſſe conflict, for that both the trueth of the cauſe it ſelfe, wil bear me vp, that I ſlip not, and alſo your honorable fauours (as I hope) wil beare me out, if I ſlip not.</p>
            <p>And now, if it ſhall pleaſe God to put them in ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mind, whome theſe things do chiefly concerne, ſo that theſe may be commended of them, and they amended by theſe, I verely ſhall reioyce in them, but they ſhall be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:8306:8"/> vnto you. But if theſe thinges diſpleaſe them, and they finde themſelues offended with my liberty, I ſhal find others (I doubt not) as amorous of the preſent truth, as they are of their priuate humor, and as far in loue with reuerend an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, as they are in liking with inſolent noueltie; vnto whom I perſwade my ſelfe (though they ſhould fore-ſpeake the contrarie,) this my labour ſhall not bee altogeather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome. Wherefore for your Honors I will pray, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune the moſt great and Almighty, that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to giue you life, euen a long life, for the benefite of the Church, and the aduancement of the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T what time I liued at Leiden (worſhipfull and beloued) I many times, with many of you, bewailed the ſtate of the Church there: In the which, the deuill, (the deuill it is) ſpreadeth his net, as many other waies, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciallie nowe with a certaine newe ſlight after another faſhion: In the which he hath his gins and engins, nothing like vnto thoſe of olde, when hee went a hirding with gainefull hipocriſie, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled the ſoules of Chriſtian people with a kind of coſtlie ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: then did the Cleargie, and the Layitie ambitiouſlie contend, (as yet they continue vnder the Papacie) whether ſhould exceed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: they in their pompous ſanctimonie, or theſe in their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous munificencie: So they, ſold (and ſell) at a deare reckoning: theſe, bought (and buy) at the hucſters handes: The one deceiuing, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceiued; both in an error, neuer a better. And is it not ſtrange to ſee (a thing that is not ſtrange,) how ſuperstition and hypocriſie is of more force and preuaileth more, to conquere and lead captiue the minds of men, then true and ſincere religion, which is pure and plaine, without wealt or gard? But ſuch is either the negligence of men, or the nature of man, it will be deceiued, and will deceiue. Who is able to recompt (and keepe reckoning,) the quircks and the tricks, the gybing and the iugling of the Romaine Alcaron, by the whiche they hold play with the ſimple, and play noddie with the peoples ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie? The paines of Purgatorie, the Popes pardons, Images, falſe miracles, pilgrimage to ſtatues, ſhrines and croſſes, reliques of ſaints, bones, teeth, and aſhes, veſtments, belts, and ſandals, and a thouſand ſuch like trumperies? Theſe are the martes and the marchandiſe which they make ouer to the peple for hid treaſure, while they ſel the people for olde ſhooes, What ſhould I more ſay? They ſay themſelues, (and the more ſhame) they are not aſhamed to ſay: <hi>That theſe and ſuch like, are the Religious illuſions of the Religious.</hi> VVhat
<pb facs="tcp:8306:9"/> a commodious craft auricular confeſsion is, the Ieſuits (beſides other the Romiſh Prelates minions) doe feele, and find. But now adaies, becauſe the true Miniſters of Chriſt, and the faithfull ſtewards of his houſe are not trained vppe in theſe trades, nor guiltie of theſe traines, they are ſet at naught of naughtie men.</p>
            <p>And yet of olde, when the people doted ouer their falſe Gods, and ſpared for no coſt, ſo they might ſatisfie their ſoules with neuer-ſatisfied ſuperſtition, they were notwithſtanding nothing ſo ranke in ſeking to ſatisfie the rauine of that vnkind lust towards their falſe God and his worſhip, as they were ſlowe and ſlacke to inquire after the true God his ſeruice, and his true ſeruants: and why then ſhould it ſeeme a thing rare or inſolent among vs, if the like kinde of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnes be reuolued vpon vs in this age? For man to man, and age to age is as like, as is the water to the water, day to day, to day and heareafter.</p>
            <p>In what honour and estimation the Ministers of the Church are among the Romanists, is well knowen to ſuch as either now liue, or at anie time haue liued amongſt them. But now, amongſt vs the profeſſors of the Goſpell, they which ſincerely teach the true religion, and truly teach what way leadeth to heauen, and by what means we are reconciled to God, ar ether nothing at al acounted, or as nothing. Is any thing (for honour ſake?) for pittie ſake yeelded vnto them? it is by and by thought much of, and thought too much, bee it neuer ſo little. For which ſinne, not onely the vnkindnes of the people is to bee condemned, as principallie guiltie, but our owne fooliſhnes alſo may be conuicted, as acceſſorie faultie. And howe? Forſooth a toy hath taken vs in the head, and we haue taken a toy in hand, by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing the Popes tyrannie, to ſuppreſſe our owne liberty: As if indeede, the exceſsiue riot, and not expleable auarice of the Popiſh Cleargie could by no poſsible meanes be rebated, vnleſſe wee thrust downe the reformed Ministerie beneath the Bell-ferie, and hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer head lay waſt all the poſſeſsions of the Cleargie. A paſsing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice indeede, to bring this to paſſe (as it hath alreadie brought it within come to paſſe) that the Church wanteth wherewith to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the ſacred Muſes, and is faine to honour the painefull Miniſter with monethly menſtruous fees.</p>
            <p>From hence is foisted into the Church, a kinde of temporall
<pb facs="tcp:8306:10"/> biter, after a new faſhion &amp; an euil example: who chiefly attending, vpon their own drudgerie, by the way ioyne hand with the Paſtor in his prouince, and that for a yeare or two at the moſt (that they may be good in their office.) And by this meanes, (that which I account worſe then all the reſt) the beautie of the Church is vaniſhed, and that vnited force of the brethren which in placed in one Biſhop, who dare with confidence, and may with authoritie controule the wicked in their enterpriſes, is vtterlie loſt and languiſhed. For whileſt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one is diſpiſed, all are contemned and likewiſe, whileſt euerie one taketh care of his owne Curch onelie, they altogeather neglect the good of the whole Church generallie. I ſpare to exemplifie this: your ſelues ſuppoſe, what, and where vpon I ſpeake it. But doe you not ſee, or can you not conceiue, how that many things may daily chance in the Church, which concerne all Churches in common, and for the which, a preſent remedie must be had? In this caſe no priuate man dare vndertake the cauſe: and why? he ſeeth and conſidereth that the matter pertaineth not to him, or to anie one, or to a few, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the reſt of that whole Prouince in common. But whileſt hee which could find in his heart to put himſelfe vpon the action for the common good, yet findeth many doubts in his hart, and is ſtil affeard leaſt either himſelfe ſhould not be allowed, or that he ſhould perform not confirmed, by the rest; of neceſsitie the time is deferred in this neceſsitie, and needs muſt a further time be expected, vntil the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren may bee aſſembled. That a Synode ſhould bee called for euerie ſuch matter, it is both coſtly and inconuenient: and many times alſo before either they could be called, or come togeather, either the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that was feared would be receiued, or the occaſion that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered would be ouer-paſſed, whereby the euil might ether altogether, or more eaſily haue bene remoued.</p>
            <p>Amongſt you, the Church-goods are rifled and ruined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie reuerend regard of ſacred or prophane: as if (forſooth) it were religion for the Church of Chriſt to bee woorth one dodkin in a chriſtian Common-wealth: or as if indeed it were the onely errour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they are rich. Doth anie thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine yet vnranſackt in any of your Churches? the better for thoſe Burgreeues and Burgomaiſters in whoſe handes it is. As for your ſelues, there is not ſo much as one mite left to bee at your diſpoſing:
<pb facs="tcp:8306:10"/> you that ſtand ſo much in your ownlight, and haue put out two lights with your too much lightnes, can you put out mine with an half pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? alas good ſouls: if you were euerie one pore, yet might you be all rich. But now it is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion, that Paſtors ought of congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be poore and needie: and that is ſo deeplie infixed in the harts of the ſimple peple, that they can hardly be perſwaded to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Is it poſsible, but by ſuch meanes it ſhuld one day come to paſſe (if they thus proceed) that the whole Miniſtery of the Church ſhuld fal ether into vtter decay, or wretched conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt? I was purpoſed (if I had ſtaied with you) to haue conferred about this matter with the States themſelues. And verely I would haue exhorted and intreated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they would take ſome better courſe in this cauſe: I would haue taught them, that they had no right at all vnto the church-goods: I would haue prooued and proteſted vnto them, that whatſoeuer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities haue befallen the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> they are al but the iuſt vengeance of God for their ſacrilege: that the goods of Cathedrall and Collegiat churches, and alſo of many Monaſteries, were desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and conſecrated to the vſe of ſacred ſtudies: And laſt of all, I would haue informed them, and confirmed to them, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath varied from the first inſtitution therof, ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, but reſtored by the chriſtian Magiſtrate. But this my good purpoſe was hindered, firſt by the vntimely death of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and then alſo for the Earle of <hi>Leyceſter</hi> his ſake: Leaſt I might ſeeme to haue attempted the ſame, either at a bad time, (in the greateſt tumult of the countrey) or els by bad means (preſuming vpon the fauour and furtherance of my L. the Earle.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, I might greatly wonder at the error of many, and they not meanely conceited towards the Goſpel: neither ſhould I ceaſe to wonder, were it not that I knowe the Miniſters themſelues, whome the matter doth more neerly concerne, to bee the authours of that error. But when I conſider with my ſelfe the iniquitie of theſe euill daies, and the bad meaning of euil men, I cannot wel tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I might rather lament or reioyce in that their foule ouerſight. For albeit to haue the churches ſpoyled &amp; left deſolat of ſuch helps with the which it ought to be releued, may bring vpon both Church and State a greater miſery then many can ſuſpect, or any can auoyd: notwithſtanding, that in the beginnings of reformation, there was
<pb facs="tcp:8306:11"/> nor mention nor motion made for the Church-goods, it greeueth me the leſſe; for that by this meanes the aduerſarie cannot well ſay, that we rather ſought the treaſure of the Church, then the glorie of God. For had they made anie question of the Church-goods, theſe cauils and quarrels might haue taken ſome aduantage of them. But now, when as they eſteemed of whatſoeuer the Papiſts poſseſſed, as of things nothing pertaining vnto them, and referred all the whole matter to the moderation of the Magistrate; by this meanes, Suſpicion it ſelfe could not but cleare them of ſuſpicion. <hi>So God ſometimes doth vſe the verie ignorance of his ſeruants, to ſome good end:</hi> namelie, <hi>when as a truth taught out of time, would doe more hurt then good.</hi> Notwithſtanding, that which ſometimes hath beene obiected, can neither be denied nor defended; that there were ſome which tooke our part in hope of the pray onely. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit theſe things were not altogether vnknowen vnto the godlie at that time, (as their writings doe witneſſe) yet in wiſdome they choſe rather to ſuffer and ſay little to that iniurie, then that in haſt they ſhould goe about to offend any. And in this they did imitate Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who in the rich Cittie of <hi>Corinth,</hi> had rather labour with his hands, and ſo get his maintenaunce, then otherwiſe to giue anie occaſion of ſuſpect to a nouice people, not ſeene into the dignitie of his right Apoſtolique. And ſhall I tell you? that onely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was not the leaſt cauſe, why my ſelfe dared not bewray vnto euery one the ſilence of my thoughts: And yet (ſuch was my natiue weakenes, or my foole-hardie forwardnes) I could not hide my ſelfe from my brethren and companions, and ſome alſo of the Magiſtrats of <hi>Gaunt.</hi> But I ſpake not then ſo freely, as I meane to doe in this diſcourſe: For I alwaies feared, as I ought to do, leaſt ſuch as were but newly wonne to the faith of Christ, might be haplie lost by my indiſcreet libertie, and my ſelfe brought into a needleſſe gealoſie of auarice and ambition.</p>
            <p>But now, ſeeing I am in that place and condition, in the which no man can iuſtly accuſe me, as if I ſought any eſpeciall commoditie for my ſelfe, or deſired any other thing, then that which is commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and neceſſary for the Church: I thought it my duty to ſpeake plainely, what I thinke of the goods and poſſeſsions of the Church. Neither is it enough for mee, that I am heere well prouided for my
<pb facs="tcp:8306:11"/> ſelfe: I wiſh the like vnto my brethren. And although I may iuſtlie complain my ſelf, to be iniuriouſlie forſaken of you, whom I ought to haue found the chief Patrons of mine innocency: yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, my loue and my Zeale, both towards the Church, and alſo vnto you-wards, is not therefore either altered, or alienated. And how then ſhuld I be leſſe carefull for yours &amp; your Churches good, then when my ſelfe was in the ſame ſhip with you? VVherefore, ſeeing we haue now ſufficientlie wincked at this errour, as well of the people, as the Magiſtrate, which (if it be ſuffered) will bring to the Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a deadly ruine, or a deſperate miſchiefe: we may no longer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the matter; the Church it ſelfe must be taught hir duetie towards hir Miniſterie. It is a perilous &amp; pernitious thing, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath an euill preſident vnto our posteritie: who ſhall take all for reformation, whatſoeuer they receaued in the name of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for what cauſe ſo euer it was done.) Men (as you know) for the most part, vſe rather to regard the deed, then to reſpect the cauſe: what is doone euerie man can tell, but for what cauſe it was doone, there are few which can conceiue, or well conſider.</p>
            <p>I muſt needes confeſſe, I haue proceeded ſome-what farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this matter, then my purpoſe was, when I came firſt hither: For that I ſee heere in <hi>England,</hi> by the euill preſidents of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, moſt men are carried away with the ſame errors. Some ſtreine their conſciences ſo farre, and open their mouthes ſo wide, that like dronken men they ſtretch and yawne after the Church-liuings, and doe euen gourmandize them already in their hopes mercileſse, and bottomeles conceits. And ſome againe while they grutch the Paſtors their fields, and enuie the Euangelique Biſhops the riches of Romiſh Prelates, (as if it were not lawefull for vs to ſucceed them, and not exceed them) would ſeme to eat their hearts in garlike (as they ſay) while they eat and ſpit their owne gall in malice. A ſtrange opinion they hold, that the place, power, and authoritie, it hath pleaſed her Maieſtie and the reſt of the states, the Biſhops ſhould reteine in this kingdome, is a grant vtterly auerſe vnto the reformation of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. VVherefore now, what honour is due in a Chriſtian Common-wealth to the Miniſters of the Church, and how forforth the ſame may extend, is to be examined more at large.</p>
            <p>But it is to be feared, leaſt ſome will be ſcarcely well pleaſed,
<pb facs="tcp:8306:12"/> eſpecially ſuch as be ignorant of the auncient Church gouernment) with this my treatiſe <hi>of the diuers degrees of the Miniſters of the Goſpell:</hi> and the rather, for that I haue noted in their newe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reformation two things not to be liked of: namely, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentique order of Biſhops is abrogated, and a nouell kinde of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters intruded. The which I haue the rather noted, for that the common ſort of people are of opinion, that not the leaſt part of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation conſiſteth in the dilapidation of Church-goods, in the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Prouinciall Biſhops, and in the creation of Demi-laicall, and mongrell Presbyters. The which opinion of the people, I doe therefore reprehend, not that I diſſallow, that certaine graue ſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and godlie men ſhould conſort with the Pastors, (that is, the true Presbyters of the Church:) but that they may know, (as they ſhall be taught) not to mistake them for thoſe Elders, of the which, in the Actes of the Apostles, and in <hi>Paules</hi> Epiſtles there is often mention, and is it not needful alſo, to point at an error betimes, leaſt it beeing by time confirmed, ſhould not afterwardes be eaſilie correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall thinke my ſelfe in the error, or that I haue gone further then he liketh well of: let him teach me that which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I will preſently alter my iudgement, and giue ouer the bucklers vnto him that can do beſt. The which I ſpeake not as if I doubted, or were not thorowlie reſolued, that thoſe things of the which I affirme in this book, were not aſſumed out of gods book. (For I do verely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that I haue not ſwarued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that rule which God hath giuen me to follow.) But yet, if any man preſume he can teach the contrary out of the word, (and make not the word contrarie) I am more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to attend and be taught, then to teach, and had rather bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, then ouercome: condition, that that onely truth may preuaile, which in truth ought to preuaile. In the meane while, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies borne, and beare with ſuch as diſſent in opinion from me, (ſo long as they holde intire the Lorde Ieſus:) ſo likewiſe in the ſame charity may they beare with me, if I diſſent from them, I hartelie wiſh, and intreat earneſtly. If it ſhall pleaſe God, by the counſel of chriſtian Princes, that there may be a generall and a free councell ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, that (as it becommeth me) I refuſe not to bee iudge of my iudgement: but if otherwiſe, neither I can bee perſwaded by others,
<pb facs="tcp:8306:12"/> nor perſwade others: let vs expect with one accord the iudgement of Almightie God, when euery one ſhal render according to the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his talent, a reaſon of his Miniſterie. For me to contend with my brethren after a bitter manner? it is no part of my meaning. If in any place my ſtile ſhall ſeeme more ſharpe: beleeue me, (I will not fable with you) the greatnes of the miſchiefe, not any priuat griefe, hath ſet an edge on it. And to ſpeake reaſon, what reaſon haue I to be violent, or virulent in this question? Seeing whatſoeuer is helde amiſſe, I impute it to the error and ignorance of art, not to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or euill meaning of men.</p>
            <p>The horrible ſacrilege of men is not ſo manifest to the world, as the execrable authors thereof are vnknown vnto me: (and it gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me not that they are vnknowen.) Of whome then ſhould I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime? Againſt whome ſhould I declaime? But whereas certaine vngodly men are craftely crept in amongſt vs, who make a ſhewe of religion, and would ſeem to fauor the Goſpell, and that not ſo much of any deuotion towards God, as in deteſtation of all godlines: I am constrained many times, more earneſtly to inueigh against the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie and impietie of ſuch: (let them be of what eſtate they may be, if they be of that condition) For neither are our owne colours cleare of ſuch ſtaines: againſt whome can there bee anie worme-wood too bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
            <p>This I note, that if at any time I name the Hollonders, I note not the whole nation: (God forbid) but onely thoſe that degenerate from the naturall integrity of their owne nation. But are not they ſo much the more worthy greater ignominy, by how much the more fondly they abuſe their owne authority, and the peoples ſimplicitie? ſuch therefore I must neceſſarilie, and may worthelie accuſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme and irreligion, the reſt, I cannot excuſe of errour and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance onely. Indeed error and ignorance doe ſometime mitigate the guilt of the offender, but neuer can it obliterate the staine of the offence.</p>
            <p>It will ſeeme a hard matter I know vnto ſome, that ſacrilege ſhould be openly reprehended, and vnto ſome an abſurd thing, that in the policy of the Church, Biſhoppes ſhould be required. For there are here in <hi>England</hi> a certaine number of wicked men, (and I am very ſorie for them) who are ſo farre out of order with that
<pb facs="tcp:8306:13"/> order, as if no Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline were to be had vnder them. Amongſt whome, the quarrell is growen ſo farre, that nowe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce themſelues from the communion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> church, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſticall and Antichriſtian, and ſo betake themſelues to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and not permitted conuenticles. VVhome I could doe no leſſe then lightly note in this place, becauſe they ſeem to patronage their odious ſciſme, and mutinous huggor-muggar by the precedent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of our foraine Churches. O God thou knoweſt, and themſelues cannot bee ignoraunt, that the firſt peregrine churches which were heere in <hi>England,</hi> had their Lord Biſhop <hi>Alaſco,</hi> and theſe which at this day are vnder the protection of the moſt gracious <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> doe acknowledge the Biſhops of thoſe Dioceſſes in the which they are, and to them they ſupply. But (thankes be vnto God) there are others, who being ſomewhat more milde and moderate in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, doe not altogeather eſtraunge themſelues from the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of their churches: but yet, they haue the Biſhops in emulation alſo, and promiſe vnto themſelues a golden worlde, could they but once bring to paſſe, that by a prepoſterous Alchymy of earthly pollicy they could turne gold into droſſe, that is, Biſhops into Presbiters, &amp; their reuenues into annuities. But to them I dare ſay, and can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew, that they ſhal bring, themſelues? The whole ſtate Eccleſiastik into deepe diſdaine, diſdaine worſe then themſelues deſerue. And whereas (the Lord be praiſed for it) we haue now ſome good Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, it will come to paſſe that then they ſhall haue none at all, but voluntary, which as ſoone as it is begone, will be gone. I omit the tumults and contentions with the which they ſhall firſt trouble and turmoyle both heauen and earth. But this is plaine, and I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them, that they which were the firſt authors thereof, will proue their first enemies, ſo ſone as vnder theſe colours they ſhal haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their deſires.</p>
            <p>The calamities of your preſent churches your ſelues ſee, and ſuffer: but from whence they ariſe, or what is the true remedy (pardon me, I beſeech you, if I ſpeake as I thinke) you ſeeme not to ſee or conceiue at all.</p>
            <p>Doe you not heare of the turbulent state of other Churches? and you know what they were from the beginning. Where, if they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained for a popiſh Prelat, a true BB. &amp; for Romiſh maſmongers
<pb facs="tcp:8306:13"/> Euangelique Ministers, contented and contenting themſelues, with the rites and reuenues of their owne Churches: no doubt all thinges amongſt them, had continued more peaceable and proſperous, aſwell in Church as, Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>The like I affirme of other prouinces, from whence is exiled the tyrant of Churches. But what can be done, where the mindes of men are foreſeaſoned with preiudice, and alreadie reſolued, That to bee ruled by biſhops, and to be releeued by Tythes (and other oblations of the people,) is a point of Poperie.</p>
            <p>But may I not be ſo bolde to tell them, (and I will tell them but the truth) that theſe, and ſuch like medicines as they go about to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter vnto the Church maladies, are like to prooue but prouocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto further miſchiefes? Admit the drugs they concoct be not ſimplie offenſiue, yet is it to be conſidered, (and wiſe men wil conſider) whether the faintnes and infirmitie of the whole body of the common-wealth, may abide the ſame. Here there is need of great wiſedome, &amp; no leſſe moderation: the which as it may be in many, ſo muſt it be in one, which may execute the ſame: and this is he, which is not to looke ouer one part, but to watch ouer all, not of the whole worlde, (which neuer any mortall thing, or could, or can,) but of one Cittie or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, ſo farre forth as the power of man may extend it ſelf. And may wee not alſo more ſaflie walke in the ſteppes of the auncient fathers, then raſhlie to ſtep aſide into tracts of our owne treading?</p>
            <p>Now, how you will accept of this my libertie, I cannot well tell, but I hope well of you, and commit the whole cauſe vnto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. This I am perſwaded, and this haue I learned, that in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayed eſtate, it is not the part of a good Cittizen, to ſuſpend his cenſure of the Common-wealth, nor of a faithfull Chriſtian, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his opinion of the Church of Chriſt. For mine owne part, if in this daungerous enterpriſe, I ſhall obtaine that onelie, which I haue propounded vnto my ſelfe, I ſhall haue iuſt occaſion to giue thankes vnto my GOD: but if it fall out otherwiſe, yet ſhall I haue diſcharged my duetie vnto my Brethren, and performed my vowe to the Church of GOD. Vnto the whiche, I haue hitherto thought my ſelfe indebted as muche as this comes vnto, That a knowen errour ought not to bee ouer-ſlipped in the ſilence of mee.
<pb facs="tcp:8306:14"/> But put caſe, I doe ſmale good vpon thoſe, for whoſe ſakes eſpecially I haue traueiled in this duetie; yet ſhall their remaine a perpetuall note of that notorious errour vnto all posteritie, that they yet at the length may amend that, in the which they haue found their Fathers to haue bene faultie.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hoſoeuer thou bee (gentle Reader,) into whoſe hands this booke ſhall come, in any caſe I would not haue thy minde troubled with this diſcourſe, as if we did reuerſe ſom graund Article of thy faith, when wee doe but reſtore, (for ſo we holde it behofefull) the graue Senat of Biſhops into the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches (ſo called.) Doe we croſſe herein the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome late writers of great name? Why then iudge you, (and iudge me worthie of double blame) if I ſhould be either ſo frontleſſe, or ſo forgetfull at leaſt, as to aduenture vpon this contradiction, of mine own head: ſuppoſe ye me at the leaſt, backt with the piller of truth, (the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and borne out with the conſent of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and countenaunced with the continued cuſtome of the whole Church. What then? (Will you ſaye) did they, whome you cal men of name, ſee nothing? I anſwere, they did ſee indeede, that which I ſee: But as they which take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to repaire an old houſe, albeit within dores there bee many pretie romes, and neceſſarye corners, which they would willinglie, and might well bee reſerued; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when they beholde on euery ſide, the moſt partes rotted and ruinated, and thoſe good partes to hang togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by putrified and imperfect ioyntes, they are in diſpaire, that the houſe can not bee well turguiſed, except the whole frame ſhould be ouerturned: Euen ſo the reformers of gods houſe, albeit they did ſee to their greife, manye excellent things which might well, and well worthie, bee reſerued, yet perceiuing them to be either vtterly diſteined with ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or doubtfullie entangled therewith, and conſequentlie diſpairing, that they could not roote out the grounded ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and tyrrany of the pope, vnleſſe they plucked vp by the roots many ſingular ornaments of the church; in the anguiſhe of their zeale they cried at once, downe with it, downe with it, euen to the ground. And ſo is it come to pas that togeather with impietie and Idolatrie (if not before
<pb facs="tcp:8306:15"/> them both) ſuch and ſo many inſtruments are taken away, as might haue beene verie great helpes to the Church, both for the preſeruing of Diſcipline, and alſo for the retaining of that dignitie to the Miniſterie, which is decent and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in a ciuill ſocietie.</p>
            <p>But to the purpoſe: although in materiall thinges, that which we haue exemplified before, many times muſt be ſo of neceſſitie: yet in morall cauſes there is no ſuch neceſſity. The ſtate therefore of this queſtion (friend reader) is not of thy faith in Chriſt, or of thy ſouls health, but by what guides eſpeciallye, and gouernours, thou maiſt bee beſt lead in the way of truth, and kept in the path of eternall life. And vpon this point is all this variaunce. For there are ſome of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all diſcipline of maners, is to be referred to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and that the Miniſter is to be reſtrained to the bare Preaching of the worde, and miniſtring of the Sacraments. The which fancie of men, ſeeing it hath neither the word of God to confirme it, nor any preſident of our Elders to giue countenance to it, I can but wonder, howe ſo friuelous an opinion, could once either creepe in, or peepe out of the heads of Diuines. But there are other which yeild (as they ought to doe) the power of Eccleſiaſticall cenſures to thoſe Biſhoppes and Elders, which are ſuch, both in name and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: vnto whome, they deny not that authoritie which God gaue vnto his Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. And laſt of all, there is a third kinde of them, which reiecting the order of Biſhops, ioyne with the Paſtor certain annuall Elders, vnto whome they commit the regiment or the Church, and the ordering of Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline. Thus did the Philoſophers of old, when it came in queſtion, what kinde of Gouernment was beſt: Of whome, ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Monarchie of one, and that (as it is indeed) they iudged the beſt: yet others maintained, that an Oligarchy or ioynt gouernment of a few, was as good as the beſt: again there were others, who for a Democratie, or ſtate popular, would yeeld to none of the reſt. And laſt of all, there were ſome, who to the former three added a fourth, which they
<pb facs="tcp:8306:15"/> indifferently, (not equally) mixed of all three; and that they would make good, to be as good as they al, and better then any of the reſt. But in the meane while they conſidered not this, that any kind of gouernment as it is in it ſelfe, is not ſo much to bee conſidered in gouernance, as is the nature and condition of them, who are to be gouerned, and for whoſe good that kind of gouernment is ordained. So that nowe, that forme of pollicie is to bee accounted beſt, not which is ſuch in his owne nature, but that which is moſt neceſſary for the people, the time, and the place. For which cauſe, (as I conceaue) GOD himſelfe in the ſecrecie of his wiſedome, hath not ſet downe vnto any nation, any perpetual forme of gouernment, the which it was not lawful to alter according to the incidencie of time, place, and perſons.</p>
            <p>But in the gouernment, of the which we diſpute, the caſe is far otherwiſe: for in that it proceedeth immediatly from God, men maye not alter the ſame according to their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, neither is it neceſſary: For the wiſedome of God hath ſo tempered the ſame, that it repugneth no form of ciuil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. In deede, where any one whole ſtate is become Chriſtian, the gouernment happelie may receiue ſome kind of alteration, but not ſuch as ſhal alter the nature of it. Were they before in gouernment diuerſe, and in no one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like? nowe they conſort in one, and lend each other their mutuall aide. Wherefore, whatſoeuer other men thinke in this matter: doubtleſſe the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, in a well ordered ſtate, ought not to bee held as a priuate perſon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or common-wealth. The which diſtinction beeing not ſufficientlie looked into, hath diſtracted vs into diuerſe errors in Church Diſcipline. For my part, (and the beſt wil take my part,) I hold, that the ſtate of Biſhops is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the Church, &amp; that Diſcipline is beſt and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, in the which, godly Biſhoppes, with the not nick-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Elders do ſit at the helme.</p>
            <p>And yet when I conſider with my ſelfe, the badnes of theſe times, and the badde condition of ſome places, in the which it hath pleaſed God, by the hands of learned and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb facs="tcp:8306:16"/> men to gather togeather his diſperſed flocke out of the captiuity of Babilon. I doe not ſee indeed, how the true Biſhops could haue bene reſtored. In the Churches of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Holland, my ſelfe haue ſuſteined the office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor: but ſhall I tell you? I cannot eaſily tell, how many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments I there found in this buſines. But ſhal that which was done extraordinarily, and partly of neceſſity, and that but in a certaine fewe places, and that but in our age onely, preſcribe a law to the world beſides? This diuorce of minds and opinions had neuer bene, were it not for the tyrrany of ſome miſrulie Biſhops, a nouell opinion is crept vp, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it ſelfe againſt all antiquitie, which holdeth all Biſhops generally in iealouſie: and yet, the like and no leſſe ſuſpicion is raiſed of our newe conſiſtories alſo, wheather rightlye or wrongfully, I will not ſay.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, he that will vndoubtedly attaine to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of theſe thinges indeed, muſt bee ſure, that he examine and try the cauſe him ſelfe, deuoyd of all paſſion or preoccupation of affection. Many times within theſe ſixe and twentie yeares, haue I deliuered my minde vnto my friends in familiar conference, (though not at all times, nor to all) concerning the gouernment of Biſhops. What they would conceiue of mee for ſo doing, I might eaſily coniect by others, who had in like maner reueiled themſelues vnto their brethren. For as it happened, a certaine diſputation fel out between certaine Miniſters, concerning the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: in the which M. Doctor Villerius, (whoſe name I cannot remember without due reuerence) aſſumed, that the authority of Biſhops was not ſo raſhly to haue bin reiected. But Lord, how they were netled and neſtled with this? as if with that one word, he had vtterly ouerthowen that equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which they expected in the French churches, and which they thought requiſite in all Miniſters. O griefe: to me they made knowen their griefe, and (pittifull complaining) they complained to me thereof. But what ſhould I heere do? de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him I dared not, (and yet I liked well the cauſe of his opinion,) leaſt I ſhould incur the like ſuſpicion of aſpiring
<pb facs="tcp:8306:16"/> thoughts. But from that time forwarde, that conference gaue mee occaſion to ſearch and ſift out more narrowlye, thoſe matters by my ſelfe. And that which then happened to me, I doubt not but is incident to many others with me, who in wiſedome ſee, alſo and conſider, that the authority of Biſhops is greatly wanting in ours, and al Churches.</p>
            <p>There are ſome which can indure, nor equall, nor ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour: I giue God thanks, I can ſee my ſuperiour without enuy, and ſuſtaine my inferior without contempt. But now, ſeeing I am heere in England, no man can chalenge my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as guiltie of a Biſhoppricke, or as if I ſeeke dominion ouer my brethren: (the calling I affect, but not to be called.) And therefore now I dare more boldly, and will more freely ſpeake what I thinke, then before I thought it requiſite; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it conuenient, when I conuerſed among brethren neuer-a better.</p>
            <p>Yea, but I may ſeeme in this action, to ſooth vp the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and ſeeke their countenance: countenance? nay then muſt I ſeeke further, and neuer look the Biſhops in the face, whoſe condition in this thankles age, is more ſubiect to the enuie and obliquie of men, then my ſelfe am. And indeed, if that were all, and all but ſo little, it were the part of a warie child, and him that would husband his credite to make the moſt of it, rather with ſafetie and ſilence to ſay nothing, and with patience and pollicy, to expect the iſſue of theſe things. The which I dare ſaye, I alſo could haue doone as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without diſpleaſure to my ſelfe, or disfauour to anie. But what moued me, God knoweth: men may conſtrue my fact as themſelues affect: but it is the Lord that iudgeth my ſoule. Notwithſtanding, let the curteous Reader conceiue my meaning in few words: I deſire to benefite the churches alreadie, and to be reformed, to extirpate Sciſme where it is rooted, and to preuent it where it is riſing. He that thinketh this cannot be done by theſe meanes, ſhall haue his own ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for me: but yet the euent of things (mother of fooles,) will one day make it plaine, howe good and profitable my meaning was; and in the meane while, the Church (if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb facs="tcp:8306:17"/> not) maye receiue that detriment, which it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire.</p>
            <p>The ground of our ſaluation, is to know God, &amp; whom hee hath ſent, Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde and Sauiour, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of of our ſoules. But as in euerie thing which men goe about: whether weauing, caruing, or any other craft, of the which, either the Citie, or the ciuill Magiſtrate hath any care, that it ſhould bee well done, there muſt bee a decent order kept, and a diligent ouer-ſight had of the works, the which by how much the more curious it is, by ſo much the things themſelues doe flowriſh the better, and continue the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: So likewiſe in Religion, the ſame order and ouer-ſight ought to be had, if we wil haue the ſame to flowriſh amongſt vs, or to continue pure and intemerate for euer. But that al men doe not agree about the maner of ordering and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church, why ſhould that trouble the quiet of anie peace-able man? Doe yee not know, that the more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neceſſarie a thing is to bee vſed, the more lets and delaies are made by the enemy, either to infect, or els to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the vſe thereof? Was there euer at any time, anie thing ſo cleare and manifeſt among men, that was out of all controuerſie? How then knoweſt thou this, that thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt nothing? Or how commeth it in queſtion among men, whether a man ſeeth, or doth that, which in very deede, hee both ſeeth and doth? Without controuerſie there is no part of Philoſphie, or precept of Diuinitie, no point of Religion, which hath not bene called into controuerſie; <hi>This ſore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile hath God giuen to the ſonnes of men, that they might be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therein.</hi> But the vanitie of mans will, detracteth nothing from the veritie of anie thing. And therefore, goe to gentle Reader, be doing with the ſequell, and doe well by it.</p>

            <head>THE PRAEAMBLE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſurpriſing of the Biſhop of Rome his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, to whoſe ſcepter (a croiſier) all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and kingdomes, and empires were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled, is, now of late growen ſo hotte, that now a daies, all Primacie, and the name of Primacie is found guiltie, (not guiltie,) and thought worthie to bee exiled the Church of Chriſt: (wiſely.) For by that meanes, all the tyrranie of Prelates may be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But they are farre wide in my iudgement. The Tarquines once exiled Rome, the very name of King becam odious amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them: as if (for-ſooth) with the name of thoſe tyrants, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie had ceaſed. But were they not afterwardes (and then iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie) thralled and threſhed, as men threſh corne, with more, &amp; more kinds of tyranny, then if they had retained ſtill the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine name of Kings and their princely authoritie? Neither indeed, is there any tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny at all in the name of a King, but in the nature of a Tarquine. And the like wee may iuſtlie ſay in this action: that the pride and tyranny, with the which the Church of Chriſt was wearied and waſted, was not in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of Biſhops and Archbiſhoppes, but in the perſons which did abuſe their authoritie, and going beyond their commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, extended the bounds of their Prouince, further then might lawfully ſtand with the modeſtie and moderation of chriſtian Religion: by which meanes indeede, the power of Rome is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exceſsiue and inſupportable. But ſhall I now, vppon this bare preſumption, indite of tyranny, the more auncient forme
<pb facs="tcp:8306:18"/> of Church pollicie, and ſo many godly men, (or rather Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men) of rare learning, ſincere liues, and ſound Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or ſhall I condemne of error, thoſe ſacred and religious Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes, in the which, holy men of God did ratifie that auncient pollicie of the Church, which with reuerence (as they ought,) they receiued of their godlie predeceſſors? Farre bee that ſinne from my thoughts, as far as is this impure age from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. For albeit I am not ignorant, that both Fathers and Councels may erre, (if they enact againſt the will and word of God,) notwithſtanding, it followeth not, that therefore they erred in this. But if ſo be we were thus equally affected towards others and our ſelues, that as we know a natural infirmitie to be vniuerſallie infuſed in the natures of all men, ſo with all we wold acknowledge the ſame, to be particularlie impriſed in our ſelues alſo: we would then more diligently ſearch and prie into the reprehenſion of our ſelues, rather then of others: But now it is far otherwiſe with vs. Is there anye thing in the Fathers (for ſome eſpeciall cauſe moouing vs) miſliked of vs? By and by we haue this theoreme at our fingers end: We muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>they were but men;</hi> and becauſe men may eaſilie erre, we muſter whatſoeuer we miſ-conceiue of them, among the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of that age. In the meane while, wee neuer remember our ſelues, <hi>that we alſo are but men,</hi> and therfore may erre with them: yea, we are ſuch men, (neither are we exempt from the common infirmitie of men) who may then er, when we thinke amiſſe of them, and in that verie thing may wee erre, for the which we condemne them.</p>
            <p>This is once: that againſt the conſtant and conſonant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions of the ancient church, we ought not to attempt, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit anie innouation, without a plaine commiſsion from Gods holie writ: and this alſo I dare boldly ſay, that whoſoeuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away al authoritie from the Fathers, he leaueth none for
<pb facs="tcp:8306:18"/> himſelfe. Indeed it muſt bee confeſſed, that the Fathers were men, and that they had their wrinckles: yet can it not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that to haue our Fathers to bee our Patrons in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points of faith, and externe pollicy of our church, (things controuerted betweene the Popelings and vs) is a matter of no ſmall moment, and of eſpeciall account. And albeit, the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme conſent of Gods children from the Apostles times vnto this day, may not be compared with the eternall word of God: Notwithstanding, of right it may come in, and ſtand for the ſecond place.</p>
            <p>The cuſtome of gods people, receiued of all Churches tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out the whole world, is in maner of a lawe, ſacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable: Neither is there any likelihood, that there could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue beene an vniuerſall conſort of all Churches and ages, without either the authoritie of gods word, or the tradition of the Apoſtles. Notwithſtanding, for as much as no conſent, no cuſtome, no auncient preſcription, can, or ought to preuaile in the Church of Chriſt, againſt the word of God; Therefore, thoſe reaſons are to be weighed, and thoſe Scriptures to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, which mooued the Fathers to intertaine, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue that Church gouernment, which our newe reformers will in no caſe agree vpon; that we may certainelie know, whoſe is the error; theirs, or ours.</p>
            <p>The time hath bene, when no good men diſallowed of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Archbiſhops: but now, in deſpite of the Popes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, &amp; his complices, it is come to this paſſe, that their very names are called into question: and that of diuerſe men, for diuerſe cauſes. Some, becauſe they are (as they ſuppoſe) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes of Antichriſt, or his fore-runners, thinke them vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie thee Church, and worthie to be caſt ouer-boorde. Others, yet more modeſt, in ſome reuerence of antiquitie, thinke they may be borne with all for a time, (although in the mean
<pb facs="tcp:8306:19"/> time they allow not of them) vntill ſuch time, as commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the names may bee antiquate with the thinges themſelues. In the meane while, for that they know, (neither can they be ignorant) to what ſingular effect the Church of God hath bin gouerned by graue and godlye Biſhops, they haue not the face to condemne them openly: yet becauſe they ſee certaine refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches of this age, to be gouerned without Biſhops: It is enugh: they haue not the power any longer to tollerat the more auncient gouernment. O the regiment of Paſtors and Elders paſsing all antiquitie, our ſoules haue longed for thee, and we haue a deſire vnto thee: for that thou alone art grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Lord Ieſus his inſtitution, and thou, (if any) art wholy purified of all tyranny and ambition.</p>
            <p>O, but by your leaue (good brethren) the ſhadowe you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, is no ſubſtance: neither is the plot you conceaue, a priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged place. Are you ſo far in loue with your liueleſſe Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malion, the worke of your owne hands? I know who is not: &amp; hee hath reaſon for his, why not; For neither is your newe draught of ſtraunge gouernement, ſufficientlye prooued by the word of God: neither is it yet, (or can at any time) bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the example of our Elders. And how ſhould it? (if we ſhould iudge aright of it) ſeeing it was partly vnknowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as a thing inſolent and not heard of: and partlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of them, as a thing Heriticall, and not approoued of. Wherefore, to ſpeake the plaine truth, without flatterie or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie: I thinke of this new forme of Church gouernment, as ſome thinke of our Biſhops regiment: Namely, that it is but a deuiſe of mans conceit, and there to be tollerated, where a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot bee obtained. And contrariwiſe; that which is diſallowed of ſome, as deuiſed by man, ſeemeth vnto me to bee the verie ordinance of God, and the onely true gouernment of the Church; as that which hath his inſtitution from God; not
<pb facs="tcp:8306:19"/> only in the old, but in the new Teſtament. But becauſe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with the manifolde abuſes of men: that which were to be layd vppon the perſon, is imputed to the function; as if (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) no ſuch miſcariage might befall this their nouell kinde of gouernement.</p>
            <p>The Romiſh Antichriſt, with his Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Patriarches, and Metropolitanes, hath ſo troubled and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the Church of Chriſt, that tyranny it ſelfe, is thought to bee masked vnder thoſe honeſt and honorable titles. It is moſt true: He that is once ſtong of a Serpent, ſuſpecteth euery ſtone: and once bitten of a dog, is affraid of euery cur. Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they might apply ſome remedy to this maladie, haue reuerſed thoſe names, and yet retained the ſame things; and for Biſhops, haue anoynted Superintendents, and for Archbiſhops, generall or prouinciall Superintendents: as if the controuerſie were not for the thing it ſelfe, but for names ſake. But (wiſe as we are) ſeeing the ſignification of wordes, is variable and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie: when we agree in truth, what neede theſe garboyles about termes? If the formes of gouernment, which are ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe termes, are contained in gods worde; Is there anie reaſon or ſenſe, that in diſgrace of thoſe names, theſe formes ſhould not be retained of vs? If any man obiect, that in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Biſhops there are many corruptions: I make no queſtion of that; So wee might cauill with the gouernment of the ciuill Magiſtrate: hath it not his corruptions? Haue they not their infirmities? Yet was there neuer anye that had his fiue wits, who thought that a ſufficient reaſon to remooue thoſe from their place, that are preſident in the ſtate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our queſtion is not, how the Biſhops haue abuſed their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye, but whether the Lorde hath ſo forbidden this their Primacy, that there may bee, nor Paſtor ouer Paſtor, nor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ouer Biſhop, in the outward pollicie of the Church. As for
<pb facs="tcp:8306:20"/> the reſt, if any will accuſe the Biſhops or their Conſiſtories, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of neglect dutie, or corrupt dealing: no man will be their hinderance, why they may not proſecute that, (and perſecute them) before the chiefe Magiſtrate. I take not vppon mee the apologie of anie Biſhop: I am not ſo worthie; they are not ſo weake, as that they need my Patrocinie; they are able to ſay for themſelues, and to gaine-ſay their accuſers; onely I lament, that the antique order of church gouernement, (of great and long eſteeme with our fore-fathers) ſhould be negligentlie loſt, or violently taken from vs: and I feare me greatly, leaſt in the infelicitie of this age, it be vtterly taken from vs. For who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and greeueth not to ſee, how men are ſet together vpon miſchiefe? euen to reduce the whole Miniſterie of the church, to the bare Miniſterie of the word.</p>
            <p>But this our preſent controuerſie, can by no meanes better bee decided, then by conferring the orders of the Miniſtery in that order as they were ordained of God, and deliuered of the Apoſtles: according to their ſingular degrees, and ſeuerall ſeaſons, as they were then in vſe: So ſhall we eaſily learne, what order is conſonant to the word of God, and what diſſonant: the which, that I may the better performe; there are two thinges which affoord me fit ingreſſe thereunto. The firſt is, the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of thoſe ſeuerall orders: The ſecond is, that one place of S. Paule to the Epheſians, the fourth chapter, where he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe the diuerſe Miniſteries of the church, diſtributed into their ſeuerall degrees. Wherein the first place are inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted (as the chiefe Patrons, and firſt Patriarches of the goſpel) Apoſtles; in the ſecond, Prophets; in the third, Euangeliſtes; in the fourth, Paſtors and Doctors. Of all the which, we are now to diſcourſe in their due order. And albeit Paul ſeeme to write of the functions giuen to the church after the Aſſention of Chriſt: Notwithſtanding wee will looke backe a little further
<pb facs="tcp:8306:20"/> for this matter, neither will we ceaſe our diligent perſute, vntil wee come to that time and place, in the which Chriſt ſelected his twelue Apoſtles; and ſo returne by the ſeuentie and two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, whom hee ordained alſo, and added to the Apoſtles, for the preaching of the goſpell throughout Iewrie.</p>
            <p>And albeit, this diſcourſe doe chieflie intend the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Miniſters; yet by the way, we haue ſomewhat to ſay of Deacons alſo. For whereas the doctrine of life, doth not nuſle vs vppe in anie idle contemplation of good things, but rather traineth vs vp in the practiſe of all goodnes, eſpecially of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charitie: Therefore of the Miniſterie of the goſpel, there ariſeth an other Miniſtery, which exerciſeth it ſelfe about bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely neceſſaries of this life, and conſequently hath impoſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it the diſpenſation of the church ſtocke: whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that there is a twofold Miniſtery of the church: One, which only reſpecteth the glory of God, &amp; ou ſouls helth: An other, which regardeth the procuration of earthly thinges, and the preſeruation of this preſent life. After theſe thinges handled, and ſet out of hand as I may: in the ſequel of this my trauell, I wil intreat of that honor and reuerence, which by the lawe of God, inſtinct of nature, and right of nations, is proper and peculier to the ſacred Miniſter. And laſt of all, againſt the gourmandiers of church goods, I will ſet downe and lay before their eies, the odious ſin of Sacrilege, with the dires and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments accompaning the ſame. And theſe three things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variety of their natures, I haue diſtinguiſhed into three bookes: but becauſe they are of ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie, and riſe togeather inſequence, I haue alſo laied them togeather in this one volume.</p>

               <p>Vppon diuerſe groundes of the Scripture, diuerſe defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be diuerſely framed; but I compriſe them all in one word or two, of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> and vppon his bare word I affirme:<note place="margin">1.

Tim. 3.16.</note> That the Miniſtery of the Goſpell is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diſpenſation of the myſteries of God, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto the world by the comming of Chriſt. Where I cal a myſtery, not only that doctrine of the wonderful cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile of God in the redemption of mankinde, but alſo all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which God hath annexed vnto that doctrine. And thoſe I reſolue into three ſortes: Whereof the firſt is, The preaching and publication of the Goſpell: the ſecond is, The vſe and adminiſtration of the Sacraments: the third is, The exerciſe and execution of Eccleſiaſtical gouernment.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:8306:22"/>
               <p>The preaching of the Goſpell is a ſacred Embaſſee in the name of Chriſt, in the which ſinners are intreated to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile themſelues to God; or thus; It is the publiſhing of that doctrine of free pardon of ſinnes, which Chriſt himſelfe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth from his Father, and purchaſed with his precious death; or otherwiſe alſo thus; It is the doctrine of the free iuſtification &amp; ſanctification of the holy Ghoſt, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by faith in Chriſt Ieſus. Many other definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s might be added, were it not that I delight to be briefe: Of theſe, if you couceiue what the Goſpel is, and the preaching therof, it ſufficeth, &amp; I am ſatiſfied. To the ſecond part of this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, do appertaine the commands of the Lord, to baptiſe the faithfull and to adminiſter the Lords Supper.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.19. and 18.18.</note> But to the third part (which is of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) is reſerued the power of the keies of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the preheminence of binding &amp; loſing vpon earth. And this authority hath two branches, whereof the one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſeth the Ordaining of Miniſters, the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the Cenſure of maners.<note place="margin">Act. 14.13.</note> By this power the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ordained Biſhops and Elders in the church, vnto whom they demiſed their authority; that all things might be done duely and decently, and that good order might be mantay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Church of Chriſt. In the aſſurance of this power, the Apoſtle deliuereth vnto Sathan, the ſtiffe necked and ſelfe willed enemies of the truth; &amp; of this power, in his Epiſtles he many times inter ſerteth imperious menaces with gentle admonitions. But of this matter there is ſome controuerſie in theſe daies: haue you not heard of it? neither did our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For there be ſome of ſtrange opinion (but ſtrongly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionat) that the whole Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure of maners is to be ſet ouer to the Magiſtrate; and how ſo? becauſe it appertayneth to his duty to take care for good order and publicke honeſty, and to take puniſhment of diſordered perſons &amp; pernicious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. But to the Paſtor (vnder a chriſtian Magiſtrat) no ſuch matter. Let him only teach vertue and taxe vice, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments hand ouer head. In deed he may admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh al men to proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues before they eat of that bread and drinke of that cup: to the which if they do obay, it is ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8306:22"/> much the better; but if not, yet that muſt be left between God and their conſcience. Forbid any man the Communion? God forbid.</p>
               <p>Is it not to be wondered, that they which confeſſe that the Miniſter hath power of binding, ſhould not conſider that the ſame Miniſter hath the like power of looſing alſo? Doe they not know, that there is the like reaſon of them both? or can they not conceyue, that the effects being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they are performed of the Paſtor with contrary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? It is without all controuerſie, that ſinners are looſed by the Miniſters, when remiſſion of ſinnes in the name of Chriſt is pronounced to the faithfull; But when as by the ſame power, the wrath of God and vengeance eternall is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt the vnfaithful, and that they are denied the ſweete comfort of the holy Sacraments, who doubteth, but that they are bound in like ſort? Is it not abhorring from the duety of a faithfull Paſtor, to let in Wolues into his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſheep-fold? ſo is it alſo, if he thruſt not out thoſe, which are cloſely crept in. If ſo be it ſo fall out, that any man fall from the faith after baptiſme, or when he confeſſeth Chriſt with his lips, that he deny him in his life, and within himſelf crucify agayn the God of life; What? is there here no part of the Paſtors office to be perfourmed? He ſhall reſtrayn (they will ſay) the diſobedient, &amp; releaſe the penitent. Very good. But ſeeing theſe things cannot be done, but with contrarie facultyes; as to the penitent he ſhall pronounce the ſweete promiſes of Gods mercy and receiue him into the Church; So to the diſobedient hee ſhall denounce all the dires and execrations of Gods wrath, (that he is a recreant from the kingdome of God, that he is exiled the Citty and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the houſe of God) and he ſhall deny the dogge returned to his vomit, the bread of the children of God. Wherfore as a faithfull diſpenſer of the myſteries of God baptiſeth none that was once an infidel, without ſome publique confeſſion of his faith: ſo neyther doth he receiue to the Communion a notorious ſinner, without apparant conuerſion of life. This is olde Diuinity.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:8306:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>But to ſpend many words in the confutation of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, is no part of my meaning, neither would it quite for coſt; this only cauſe would require a whole quire of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; that too painful a courſe, for ſo needles a diſcourſe. This onely ſeemeth to me a ſufficient confutation thereof, that it is a new and an vnexpert error, croſſing the aduiſed iudgement of all auncient Diuines: that I vrge them not with the Heathen, more holy then themſelues, with whom there was alwayes great difference, betweene things ſacred and prophane. But if Popiſh Prelates haue heretofore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, and abuſe at this day the lawful power of the church, by their lawleſſe tiranny, ſhall their vnlawfulneſſe make a lawfull thing of none effect? Together with religion a lawe was made, which excluded the irreligious from religion, ſince the worlde began. And is not then the condition of the Church preſent to be pittied, being now come to this ſtay, that when as it ought to be the ſchoole of vertue, it wil not endure the cenſure of conformity? And that which to the Heathen (men rude and vntaught in the true worſhip of God) ſeemed moſt beautifull in it ſelfe, and no leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the common wealth, ſhould altogether of vs Chriſtians be neglected as needeleſſe, or contemned as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious?</p>
               <p>But to returne to the principall iſſue in this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: albeit the miniſtery of the Goſpell committed to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, be one and the ſame in them all: yet in this third part, concerning the diuerſe degrees of authority, which firſt the Lord himſelfe conſtituted, and afterwardes the Apoſtles continued, there is great ods betweene them, and no ſmall inequality to be found among them. Amongſt the which, there is no controuerſie, but that the Apoſtles haue the firſt degree of dignity, Euangeliſts the ſecond, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets the third, Paſtors and Elders the fourth, Doctors the laſt. For as the authority of an Apoſtle was greater then of an Euangeliſt or a Prophet, &amp; of a Prophet greater then of a Biſhop or an Elder: ſo was the authority of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothie,</hi> who were both Elders and Biſhops, greater then
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8306:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> was the authority of thoſe Elders, whom by theyr Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique commiſſion themſelues had created in euery Towne. And albeit the Baptiſme of Chriſt be one and the ſame, by whome ſo euer it be adminiſtred, whether of an Apoſtle of the higheſt, or of an Elder of the loweſt order, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell is neither better nor worſe which is deliuered of theſe, or of thoſe: Notwithſtanding good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of gouernement doth not permitte, that the authority of al ſhould be all alike, or that the like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion ſhould be granted to theſe, and them; the conſtant and continued cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church miniſtery, deriued from the Apoſtles time, and vnrepealed vnto this day, doth euince the ſame.</p>
               <p>The firſt creation of the twelue Apoſtles, and the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Diſciples, doth containe a manifeſt demonſtration of this whole matter. For that the beginnings of the old, and new Church might accord: Firſt the twelue Apoſtles were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be the firſt Patriarches and progenitors of a newe people: but afterwards, when the harueſt was greater then the labourers, and the kingdome of Heauen already began to ſuffer violence, as the Lord ioyned with <hi>Moyſes</hi> in the old Teſtament ſeuenty Elders, to aſſiſt him in the gouernance of his people: ſo in like manner vppon the like occaſion, our Sauiour added vnto the twelue Apoſtles, ſeuenty other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And ſo in the firſt infancy of the Church, we may ſee how the Lord ordained two diuerſe degrees of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: whom when he diſtinguiſhed in number, and diſſeuered into diſtinct companies, did he not declare, that in honour and authority they were not equall, not all of a company? The which thing verily he would neuer haue done, had hee once knowen (and he ſhould know) that it had beene a ſin, for Miniſters to be diuerſe in degree, and not equal in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And theſe were the firſt preachers of the Goſpell vnder the Lords direction, whiles himſelfe was yet reſident among them. But after hee aſcended into Heauen, he rayſed vp Prophets alſo in the Church, when as at Whitſontide hee poured forth of his ſpirite, whereby he might make his Diſciples as miracles, not onely for theyr manifold langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8306:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> but alſo for theyr diuine wiſedom and fore-knowledge. But in proceſſe of time, when the number of Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and multiplyed exceedingly, ſo that themſelues were now no more able to ground and gouerne them; they took vnto them of theyr followers, and made them theyr fellow labourers. Who although they were of rare faith and rype giftes, yet were they the ſchollers and followers of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Euangeliſts, much inferiour to theyr maiſters. But when as not onely the number of the Churches, but the multitude of beleeuers increaſed ſtill aboue number, then were there ordayned for ſeuerall Churches, ſeuerall Paſtors, who in that age without diſtinction were called Biſhops and Elders. And of all theſe we purpoſe to ſpeake particularly, ſo ſoone as I ſhall haue ſhewed you my minde concerning the diuerſe kindes of Calling to the Miniſtery.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O man not lawfully called, may intrude himſelfe into the holy Miniſtery of the Church. For it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto God alone to chooſe his owne Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and to preſcribe lawes vnto men, by the which he would haue them choſen. Wherefore, there are now two kinds of lawful callings to the Miniſtery: one, when a man is called of God himſelfe: an other, when he is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of men, according to the lawes preſcribed of God. This we call ordinary, the other extraordinary. That which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary commeth to paſſe two ſundry wayes, and at two ſeuerall times: namely, eyther immediatly from God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inter-meane: or elſe from God, but yet by means of his Prophet. And that alſo is of two ſorts, eyther when ther was no certaine order ſet downe in the ſame matter, or elſe when there was a certaine order appoynted for the ſame. Of the firſt, we haue an inſtance in <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> both called extraordinarily; <hi>Moyſes</hi> immediatly from God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inter-mean: and <hi>Aaron</hi> by his brother <hi>Moyſes:</hi> Who,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8306:24"/> being ſo commanded of God, preferred to the Prieſthood, <hi>Aaron</hi> with his ſons, and the whole Tribe of <hi>Leuy.</hi> But then there was no lawe written, ſo that from them the order and function of <hi>Leuy</hi> had theyr foundation. Of the latter wee haue an example in <hi>Samuel,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God called after the order of Prieſthood was receyued and confirmed amongſt the people of God: So was <hi>Elias</hi> the Thesbite rayſed beſides the common order, when an order was ſet downe; and ſo were for the moſt part al the Prophets of the olde Teſtament. But <hi>Elizeus</hi> and others were ſo called of God extraordinarily, that he vſed in this buſines his Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> as a meane thereof. So likewiſe in the new Teſtament, Chriſt called his twelue Apoſtles, vnto whome alſo he added ſeuenty other Diſciples, when as yet there was no certayn order ſet down for the Miniſtery of the Goſpell: But <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Mathias</hi> he added to the twelue, after the inſtitution of the Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>The Priuiledge of an extraordinary calling is this, that as it hath God the only autor, ſo it hath the ſame God the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly director of the ſame. For alwayes extraordinary gifts do accompany an extraordinary calling: in ſo much that they which are ſo called of God, haue no neede to be informed of man, in thoſe things which concerne the execution of theyr charge: as it appeareth in <hi>Moyſes</hi> and the Prophets, as alſo in the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts.</p>
               <p>The ordinary calling is that, which is made of men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch lawes as God hath ſet downe for the ſame. As was the Prieſthood of the family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Leuites in the olde Teſtament: and as is at this day the calling of Biſhops and Elders, who both of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelues, and alſo of their ſucceſſors, were choſen aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants for the founding of Churches, and appoynted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents ouer them being founded, and ſo for euer (ſo long as there is a Church) are to endure.</p>
               <p>As for men, they haue no power (not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded of God) to cal any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Miniſtery extraordinarily. Wherfore they are deceiued that thinke <hi>Titus</hi> or <hi>Timothy,</hi> or <hi>Iohn Mark</hi> &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apo. followers &amp; fellow-laborers extraordinarily
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8306:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> called, ſeing they were called no otherwiſe, then were the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elders and Biſhops whom the Apoſtles ordayned ouer diuerſe Churches. Was there any thing in them ſingular or extraordinary? impute not that to theyr extraordinary calling, but to theyr ordinary conuerſing, with tutors and inſtructors, excellent and extraordinary, (the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts.) I admit theyr giftes were rare, and theyr per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections extraordinary, yet notwithſtanding (no diſpraiſe to any) they wanted much of that manhood of ſtrength, which was in theyr inſtructors, neither were they wiſer then their teachers. Neuer did Apoſtle giue Apoſtle inſtructions, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> who as they ſupplied the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles places, ſo they followed not theyr own, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles precepts. So were they at once &amp; together both ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and maiſters: for as they did conforme the Churches, &amp; informe theyr paſtors with wholeſome doctrine, ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo were informed of the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from God, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. So that <hi>Paul</hi> might boldly ſay (as he ſayd truely) What things I haue receyued of the Lord, I haue deliuered vnto you: but <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> might ſay with vs (and we with him) what things wee haue receyued of the Apoſtles, we haue deliuered vnto you. And albeit both he and we, haue receyued of the Lord, that which we haue deliuered to the Churches, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our receipt is after another ſort. They liued with the Lord, and thoſe things which they heard and ſaw, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with theyr handes of the word of life, they deliuered to the Church: but <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and all they which ſucceeded, taught and teach with vs, ſuch things as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by theyr hands vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Beſides <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy, Paul</hi> had his fellowes and ioint laborers, <hi>Sylas</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> I ſay his fellowes, not his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers; his ſchoole-fellowes, not his ſchollers. For why? they had theyr calling as he had, extraordinary from God, and therefore vnto them he ſet downe no precepts of wholeſom doctrine, he gaue no inſtructions of Church gouernement, as he did vnto <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy.</hi> Where I leaue it to euery
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8306:25"/> indifferent mans iudgement, what difference there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the calling of thoſe, and of theſe. As for the calling of thoſe, whom it hath pleaſed God to rayſe vp for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Church, there be many which moue manye queſtions, and make more to doe, then they neede: out of the which when they can no wayes winde themſelues, at al aduenture they caſt anker in this vnknowen coaſt of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary calling. But vnleſſe I be wonderouſly deceyued, they doe but ride in a ſhallow, and they neede not. For to oppoſe himſelfe againſt a falſe and corrupt opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sonne of God, or of the chiefe grounds of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euery good Chriſtian (well ſeene in ſacred writte) both can and ought. Wherefore amongſt ſo many, as God hath ſtirred vp to ſo ſingular a purpoſe (as he hath ſtirred vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) how few I pray you haue they beene, whoſe calling was extraordinary, except a few? And what then can the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary obiect in this caſe againſt the Church of England? Or wherein can it iuſtly be challenged? May it not defend her calling ordinary, as may alſo many other Churches in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many? Say that irreligion hath vniuerſally poſſeſt ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Church; I ſay, ther need no calling extraordinary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal the ſame. The Church, may be extraordinarily reformed (if ſo it be required) by them, which haue ordinary autority to performe it. We haue heard of many reformations in the kingdome of Iuda, to the which neyther ciuill Magiſtrate was ordayned more then ordinary, nor nouell Prieſthood. Did not the Prieſts themſelues, which before were defiled with foule Idolatry, purify the Temple, the people, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues together from foule Idolatry? And at this day, if the Biſhops of the French Churches, would redeeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the Popes tiranny, and ſweepe theyr Churches cleane of all error and Idolatry; what need ſhould they haue of any other calling, then that which they haue? The like I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme of all other Churches, (in what part of the world ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) which through the iniquity of theſe dayes, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the ennemy, are inuolued and ouercaſt with the moſt daungerous miſts of error and ignorance. If they pleaſe to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8306:26"/> ſend for our Countreymen, and vſe theyr counſel, they may but if otherwiſe they will not, they are to vſurpe no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer theyr Churches, but rather to reioyce and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with them for theyr conuerſion, making profer vnto them of theyr company and theyr countenance.</p>

Theyr firſt prouince extended not it ſelfe beyond the confines of Iewry; for they were then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to goe into the way of the Samaritanes, or to enter into the ſtreetes of the Gentiles. And in this theyr firſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, the Lord vnto the office of preaching, ioyned the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Baptiſme, and the working of miracles,. But ſo long as no end was impoſed vnto the ceremonies of the olde Church, neyther yet the order of <hi>Aarons</hi> prieſthood was abrogated, they founded no particular Churches, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained company and communion with the reſt of the Iewes, in ſuch things as concerned the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>But what the peculiar office of the Apoſtles was, is eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood by the commaunds which our Sauiour gaue them after his reſurrection, and alſo by thoſe promiſes which he made in <hi>Iohn,</hi> concerning the comforter which he would ſend them after his aſcention.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8306:26"/> and teach al nations, baptiſing them in the name of the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerue al things what ſo euer I haue commaunded you. And behold I am with you vntill the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words the chiefe parts of theyr Apoſtolique function, are thus to be diſcerned: The firſt, is that Legacy which is immediatly giuen them of God, vnto all nations, and not reſtrayned within any limitte; an other, is the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that doctrine which they receiued of the Lord; the third, is the adminiſtration of thoſe Sacraments which were inſtituted of God; the laſt, is the proteſtation of that eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aide, which albeit generally it concern the whole church, yet particularly it reſpecteth the Apoſtles them ſelues. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the fourteenth, and ſixteenth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the gift of the holy Ghoſt is promiſed vnto them, for the better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their Apoſtolike function.</p>
               <p>And that was it, which did ſo moderate theyr tongue and theyr talk, as that they ſhould vtter no doctrine of theyr owne, but of theyr maiſter Chriſt. And albeit the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of teaching, with the power of working miracles, were graunted out vnto others alſo, yet this alwaies remayned proper to the Apoſtles, and intire to theyr calling, that theyr onely doctrine was a paragon and a patterne, by the which al others doctrine was to be tried, And alſo: that they alone in the beginnings of the Church, conferred the holy Ghoſt vnder a viſible ſigne, by the laying on of handes, (as it is in the eight of the Actes and the ſeuenteenth verſe.) Wherefore as <hi>Moyſes</hi> had God the firſt author of the law, ſo was it requiſit the Apoſtles ſhould haue the ſame ground of theyr co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration, that the foundation of the Church might be layd ſure and indefeyſeble.</p>
               <p>As for the authority of the Apoſtles among themſelues, it was one and the ſame, and theyr honour alike: there was no ods between them, but that which eyther gifts, or graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did make. And albeit <hi>Peter</hi> be euery where called the firſt, yet was that primacy in the order only of his vocation, not in the preheminence of his commiſſion. For if ſo bee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8306:27"/> that (out of thoſe words of the Lord,) <hi>Thou art Peter, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this rocke will I builde my Church,</hi> and ſuch other like, the Apoſtles had conceyued any eſpeciall authority committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> they would neuer haue moued the queſtion twiſe after that, which of them ſhould ſeeme the greateſt.

But from this degree of Apoſtolique dignity, <hi>Iudas</hi> through his treaſonable and ſacriligious auarice fell, and into his place was <hi>Mathias</hi> inueſted after the aſcention of Chriſt: and laſt of al other, was <hi>Paul</hi> alſo aſcribed into this holy ſociety, after a right wonderfull and miraculous manner.</p>

If there were any, any more familiar then the reſt, they were but few, namely two; <hi>Ioſephe</hi> (ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the iuſt) and <hi>Mathias:</hi> of the which one (God being gouernor of the lottery) was inueſted into the place of <hi>Iudas. Barnabas</hi> alſo, was appoynted Apoſtle-like to diſcourſe through diuerſe countryes, and to plant certaine Churches, who notwithſtanding (moſt certayne) was none of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. <hi>Phillip</hi> likewiſe may be taken for one of this order, (and many other) who laboured with the Apoſtles in the work of the Goſpel. And ſeeing it is ſo plain a caſe, that theſe all were called immediatly from God, and that (as we read) God gaue vnto his Church Euangeliſts: who ſhall wee ſay were thoſe Euangeliſts, if not theſe? Reſolue then, that thoſe ſeuenty Diſciples were Euangeliſts, and thoſe Euangeliſtes inferior to the Apoſtles. For why, they were giuen as Legats or Lieutenants, vnder thoſe graund Capitains, to vndertake (with like authority) theyr taske and theyr turnes.</p>
               <p>And yet beſides theſe, the Apoſtles tooke vnto them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe others, as fellow laborers with them: But in them ther was not that valour, as was in thoſe, whom the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did chooſe, and infuſe with an Apoſtolike ſpirite. We haue read of <hi>Barnabas, Iude</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> theyr great trauel, and no ſmal autority in the Church: In which reſpect they came neare, and were next (in deede) vnto the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But how might this haue beene, if ſo be the ſpirit of God had not wholly poſſeſſed them, as it did the Apoſtles? But we knowe, how that they all met, (that were at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Mathias</hi>) the ſame day in the ſame place, with the Apoſtles themſelues, when the Lord poured forth of his ſpirite a viſible ſhape. And albeit <hi>Barnabas</hi> was no Apoſtle, none of the twelue; yet can we make no leſſe of him, then an Euangeliſt, one of the ſeuenty.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:8306:28"/>
               <p>As for <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> albeit theyr authority in the Church were great, and theyr deſertes great, for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and well penned Hiſtories of the Goſpell: yet are they not to be reputed with the ſeuenty Euangeliſtes, by reaſon theyr calling was by men vnto the Miniſtery. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in in his fourth booke againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>Luke</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>not an Apoſtle, yet Apoſtolique, not a maiſter, but a ſcholler, as he was leſſe then his Maiſter, ſo likewiſe was he ſo much the more leſſe then an other, for that he was follower of a leſſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</hi> As for <hi>Marke, Papias</hi> in his Commentaries (as <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> reporteth in his thirde booke) hath left vs this teſtimony. <hi>Marke the interpreter of Peter, wrote in deede very diligently, what ſo euer hee remembred; yet not altogether in that order, as they were ſpoken and performed by the Lorde. Neyther in deede did hee heare the Lorde himſelfe, neither was hee any follower of his, but afterwards (as I haue ſayd) became the companion of</hi> Peter, &amp;c. <hi>VVherefore</hi> Marke <hi>did not amiſſe in this, that he diuulged in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch things, as before hee committed to memory: ſeeing aboue all thinges he chiefely regarded this one thing, that neyther hee would omitte any thing he heard to be true, neyther committe any thing hee knew to bee falſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſaith hee of him: And it is well knowen, that hee was inferiour vnto <hi>Barnabas</hi> alſo, in authority: for hee was his follower, and in a manner his ſcholler; as he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Peters,</hi> and that in no other order, then were <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding, the name and credite both of <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> (for their faithfull regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Apoſtles preceptes) is ſuch, and ſo reuerend, as that their Goſpels are recorded among the canonical ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and are equaled in authority, with the more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite labours of <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And reaſon too: For in their Euangelike recordes, whome had they for theyr patternes or their patrones, but the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes? So that, whereas the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of <hi>Ma hew,</hi> may ſeeme to bee onely <hi>Mathewes,</hi> and that of <hi>Iohn</hi> to bee <hi>Iohns</hi> onely, theſe theyr Goſpels may be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Goſpels, not of <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> but of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8306:28"/> and Euangeliſts. In the which thing verily they are worthy great commendations, that they ſauoured no whit at all of men; (as commonly they doe which pen Hiſtories,) but they ſo nearely and narrowly followed the very ſpirit of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes, as if the Apoſtles themſelues had beene rather the penners, then peruſers of ſo greate a worke.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Luke</hi> is for good cauſe commended of <hi>Paul</hi> (in the ſecond to the Corinth: the eight chapter, and eighteenth verſe) when as he ſaith, <hi>VVe haue alſo ſent that brother whoſe praiſe is in the Goſpell throughout all Churches.</hi> But by theſe you may eaſely conceiue, who were properly Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes, and who not.</p>

Of the number of an hundred and twenty men, there remayn fix and thirty ſtil: whom ſeeing we neither account with the twelue Apoſtles, nor yet with the ſeuenty Euangeliſtes, it remayneth, that wee adorne them with the name of Prophets. For this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8306:29"/> it is which <hi>Peter</hi> doth inſinuat vnto the people, out of the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> (in his Apology for himſelfe and his fellowes) namely, That the ſpirite of Propheſie, promiſed of olde to be giuen out in the later dayes, was then poured forth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that aſſembly, whom then they heard preaching and propheſying in diuerſe tongues, to theyr great aſtoniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thoſe thirty ſixe men, which neyther are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed into the company of the twelue Apoſtles, nor yet are recounted in the ſociety of the ſeuenty Euangeliſts, were thoſe firſt Prophets, whom God gaue into his Church, after our Sauiour was receyued vp into Heauen. In which order (as it might very wel be) was <hi>Ananias</hi> of Damaſco reputed, and <hi>Agabus,</hi> both of them renowmed Prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> are alſo called Prophets, and for that cauſe are they ſent by the Apoſtles to Antioch, to exhort &amp; confirme the brethren. And I am of opinion, that theſe and ſuch like were properly called Prophets, not Metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſeeing they did foreſee thinges to come by the ſpirite of God, and by the ſame ſpirite reuealed things ſecret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condite. And albeit the interpreting of the Scripture bee a kinde of prophecying, yet is that kinde more proper to the Doctor, then the Prophet, and more truely may a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Doctors interpreters of the Scripture, then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. But doubtleſſe God reſtored to his Church, in thoſe latter dayes, that true kinde of Prophecy, which in Iſraell was familiar from the beginning, and in ſingular wiſedom did erect three kindes of Doctors in his Church, and gaue them to his new people; Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit, by that which I haue already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, it maye ſufficiently bee vnderſtoode, whome I call by the name of Apoſtles, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes, and Prophetes: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, becauſe thoſe names are for good cauſes giuen vnto others alſo, ſome what muſt be ſaid of them in like maner. In the Epiſtle to the Romains the ſixteenth Chapter, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus and Iunius, are called notable among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: and out of the eight Chapter of the laſt to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Titus and the brethren which were with him, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apoſtles: and in the Epiſtle to the Philippians, Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus is called their Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>The deriuation of the greeke word is well knowen, that Apoſtles are called, of ſending, for that they are Poſtes or ſpeedie meſſengers, ſent of eſpeciall purpoſe as Legates or Embaſſadours into diuers parts of the worlde; &amp; according to this ſignification, whoſoeuer is ſent as a meſſenger in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie buſines, may be called an Apoſtle. In this ſenſe, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour himſelfe, (who is Prince and Lord ouer the Apoſtles) in the epiſtle to the Hebrues, is called an Apoſtle. But (to be ſhort,) this name is no where giuen in the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any (ſo far as euer I could learne) but to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the goſpell onely: Amongſt whome becauſe there was great inequalitie; Paule calleth thoſe firſt twelue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the chiefe Apoſtles: (as it is in the eleuenth chapter of the laſt to the Corinthians,) where he ſaith; <hi>I ſuppoſe, that I was not inferiour to the chiefe Apoſtles:</hi> (as it is alſo in the 11. verſe of the 12. chapter.) By the which it appeareth moſt plainely, that beſides thoſe chiefe Apoſtles, who helde the commiſſion of their ambaſſage immediatly from God, ther were many other alſo, which were in like manner called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8306:30"/> either for that they were accounted of the Apoſtles, as fellow-labourers in their ſea-apoſtolique; or els for that they were ſent as Legates in the ſame buſines, by the church of Ieruſalem, which was the mother Metropolitane church. Among whom ſomtime, there foiſted in of their own heads, certaine other iolly fellowes, falſe Apoſtles, whom Paul cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth falſe brethren, and deceiptfull labourers: who vnder a coppie of faire ſemblance, could transforme themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the colours and companies of Chriſt his Apoſtles. And theſe were they which ſought by all poſsible meanes, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the authority of Paule, as of one (forſooth) that ſawe not the Lord in the fleſh, and therefore not worthy to mate and match with the other Apoſtles, in like equipage of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. But doe you ſee their purpoſe? Or doe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their policy? By this meanes they ment to thruſt Paul into the laſt and loweſt forme of Apoſtles, that themſelues being mate with <hi>Paule,</hi> might more eaſily giue the trueth a checke.</p>
               <p>Againſt the malapertnes of theſe men, the Apoſtle main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the authoritie of his power Apoſtolique, affirming that he was choſen apoſtle, not by men, but of God. To how great, or rather to how ſmal purpoſe ſhould the Apoſtle haue vrged this, had not the name of <hi>Apoſtle</hi> bene common vnto others alſo, which were not of that company and conuent of the twelue Apoſtles, but were ſent from men, and by men, &amp; were not immediatly from God? among whome are to bee accounted, <hi>Titus, Andronicus, Timothie, Marke,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom al poſterity hath reuerenced, and accounted for Biſhops and Archbiſhops of the church.</p>
               <p>May not the like be ſayd of the name of Euangeliſts? For who knoweth not, that the ſame name was giuen vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other, beſides thoſe ſeuentie two: becauſe indeede, they were called to the ſame function, both vnder the ſeuenty, &amp; vnder the Apoſtles. True it is, they had not the like meaſure of Gods ſpirite, and yet according to the moytie of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall talent, they did much edifie the church, and magnifie the foundation which the Apoſtles had laid. And therefore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8306:30"/> are they called <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Euangeliſts,</hi> not only in reſpect of the ſenſe and ſignification of the wordes, but alſo in regard of the <hi>Apoſtolique,</hi> &amp; <hi>Euangelike</hi> function, into the which they were aſſociate and aſſumed by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as helpers and fellow-labourers.</p>
               <p>But as for the name of <hi>Prophets;</hi> not only, they are ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſcriptures, vnto whome God hath reuealed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of things to come, but they alſo, which doe faithfullie reueile the ſecrets of Gods eternal truth to others, and know howe to apply auncient propheſies, to preſent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

For when as the Miniſtery of the goſpell, according to Gods holy inſtitution, hath annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto it a religious care, and conſideration of the poore, the Apoſtles tooke that vnto themſelues, as a thing pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to their charge: vntill the murmure and mutinie of the Greekes againſt the Hebrewes, gaue occaſion of the Deacons Election. But were there not at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, diſpenſers and diſpoſers of the common treaſure? When Chriſt himſelfe kept reſidence here vpon earth, who but Iudas diſcharged that penſion? and doubtleſſe, if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles coulde haue performed both, they woulde neuer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8306:31"/> haue giuen charge that others ſhould haue beene choſen for that charge. And yet that charge, was not ſo wholie giuen ouer of the Apoſtles to the Deacons, as that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, they thought the ſame nothing at all appertaining vnto themſelues. Haue wee not read, what Paule and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas did, beeing requeſted to bee mindfull of the poore? how vigilantly they vndertooke that care themſelues? And therefore they thought it requiſite, that the men to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen into that charge, ſhould be men ful of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But doe you not wonder now, that theſe new elects did not imploye themſelues in gathering and giuing of almes onely? Why (men forgetfull of themſelues) they take vpon them the office of teaching alſo. See how Phillip preacheth the goſpell to the Samaritanes alſo, and baptiſeth them that beleeue: how, while Stephen preached Chriſt more feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, he is become the firſt martyr of Chriſt. May we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by theſe preſidents, what the reſt of them did? or ſhall we be ſo fooliſh as to think, becauſe there is nothing writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reſt, that therefore they did nothing, or not this? Of the greateſt part, euen of Chriſt his Apoſtles, is there not deepe ſilence, or little ſayd? of whom notwithſtanding there is nothing more cleare, then that they performed their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed penſions with impeachable diligence.</p>
               <p>The like preſident therefore, hath bene well followed of our godlie predeceſſours, who did alſo imploy their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons in the miniſterie of the word, and holy myſteries. For why? they doubted (and that not without cauſe,) leaſt that profitable function ſhould become contemptible, &amp; be had in eſteeme, as ſtewardiſh and too homely, and not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, or not beſeeming the ſacred miniſterie. Wherfore, that they might be of greter reuerence &amp; regard in the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, they were permitted to read the goſpel to the people, &amp; to miniſter the cup in the Sacramental ſympoſy. And at the length, their autority increſed ſo far, that no BB. wold want his Deacon: yea, ſooner would a Biſhop want his Prieſt, then be without this Deacon. But now, how this kind of Deaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie deceaſed, it is nothing to our purpoſe: It ſufficeth mee,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8306:31"/> that I haue ſhewed, what was of olde the office of Deacons. I need not adde, that what thinges the Apoſtle requireth in Deacons, are in a manner equall with thoſe he deſireth in a Prieſt: But this I maye ſay, that by that onely one thing, it may full well appeare, that the office was then eſteemed as a charge of no ſmall import. And therefore, it neede not ſeeme ſo ſtrange a matter to any man, if ſome greater thing then a Church-warden-ſhip was committed to the order of Deacons, by our honorable predeceſſors. The which I note to this end, that al men may know, how the churches of old committed no abſurd thing in this, nor we (if there be any which at this day, doe immitate them) when they make the Deacony a degree to a further miniſterie.</p>
               <p>This therefore is the fourth order of the miniſtery, acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of time; and the firſt, that was deuiſed of man, when as yet there were no other Prieſtes created, then thoſe whome the Lord himſelfe had inueſted with his own hands. Now, whether this order be obſerued euery where, that they ſhould bee created Deacons before they be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prieſts, I cannot tel. In the epiſtle to Titus, in the which Paul commandeth, that hee ſhould retaine Paſtors in euerie citie: there is no mention made of Deacons. And in the 19. chapter of the Acts, where it is ſaid of Paule and Barnabas, that they ordained Paſtors in the churches, there is nothing ſaid of Deacons. And indeed, for aſmuch as there are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parts required in a Prieſt, then in a Deacon; a competent Deacon might ſooner be had, (where need was) then a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Prieſt: whoſe preſent want, the Apoſtles and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes themſelues (for a time) could better ſupply, then of Deacons: becauſe the function Apoſtolique, is further from procuring the Church treaſuries, then from Preaching the meere ſacred myſteries. With the which, this alſo is to be conſidered, that the neceſſities of the poore, are not patient of any long delaies.</p>
               <p>That Paule in his fourth chapter to the Epheſians, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no mention of this order, it need not greatly to trouble any: ſeeing his purpoſe was not to ſpecifie al the degrees of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8306:32"/> the miniſtery, but only to note the eſpecial. Our Sauior him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe taught, that care &amp; compaſsion ſhewed to the poore, was a moſt bleſſed worke: when hee ſaid, That was giuen or not giuen to himſelfe, that was graunted or grudged the poore. But in the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome churches in theſe dais, it is now no more a church office, but a ciuil duty. The care of the poore, ouer-ſight of the hoſpitals and widowes, and orphans, which was wont to be the Biſhops charge, the Magiſtrate hath taken to himſelfe. But vpon what occaſion it firſt grew to this vnder the Biſhop of Rome, I will declare els where. No doubt the Magiſtrate, that deſireth to reſtore the church to her firſt beauty, will refer that function to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſons. For if they ſhall find any corruption in them, it ſhall be alwaies in their power to puniſhe the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to amend the fault: but it is not in the Biſhops or Paſtors power, to doe the like, if it ſhall fal out, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates themſelues, or they which are deputed by them in theſe affaires, ſhall in like manner offend. Ought they not to conſider, that the ſame thing may befall themſelues, which they feare in the miniſterie? No queſtion, the miniſterie of the poore, is a religious thing, &amp; part of gods ſeruice. Wher I find two thinges greatly to be complained of: Firſt, <hi>that in ſome reformed churches, the whole office of a Deacon, is made oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micke, ruſticall, and not vnlike vnto an annuall baliwick:</hi> &amp; then, <hi>That the order of Deaconiſſes,</hi> atending vpon the poore, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſick, (of the which, there is yet ſome ſhadow remaining in the Papacie) is among vs altogeather relinquiſhed. It is much to the purpoſe (in my iudgement) how and of whom the neceſsities of the pore be relieued in the houſe of God. I am not ignorant indeed, that the old cuſtom of the church is growen to ſome ſmacke of ſuperſtition: but this of ours, which we now haue, whether (a Gods name) wil that grow? Wee are apt to fall from ſuperſtition to prophanation, but to keepe the golden meane, we haue no meanes.</p>
               <p>It hath bene of olde, the greateſt beauty of the Church, the greateſt praiſe of the Paſtors; bountie towards the needy, and mercy towards the diſtreſſed. And what ſhould I ſay of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8306:32"/> noble women (and no leſſe renowmed) maids and widows, Queenes and Empreſſes, who of their earneſt deuotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, &amp; their inward compaſsion towards the poore, haue wholy conſecrated themſelues (vnder their ſuperuigill Biſhops) vnto this holy miniſtery.</p>
               <p>When I looke into our churches, I cannot but prefer the commendable care of them, who continue in the church the true Deaconie, before thoſe, who (as if it were ſome vile and ciuill charge) trauerſe it ouer to men of life and profeſsion vnhallowed and prophane (For ſo they range the collectors for the pore, among the baſeſt drudges of the cittie.) But in this I pittie them, that ſatisfiyng (if not rather deceiuing) themſelues with the bare name, they ſeeme not ſufficientlie to conceiue the true and full nature of a Deacon. Of the which, there are yet many thinges to be ſpoken, but my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe plies it, and applies it ſelfe to the order of Elders and Biſhops.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the eleuenth chapter of the Acts, is the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion made of Elders, in the church of Ieruſalem: In the which, ſo long as the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue, they had no need of any other elders. But after they once began to be diſperſed (Iames their head being cut of, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſlipt aſide) then they began to haue their Elders, whome (from that time forwards) <hi>Luke</hi> alwaies ioyneth with the Apoſtles, which were at Ieruſalem: but when and how, and of whome they were ordained, it is not read. Notwithſtanding this order, although it was ordained in the church after Deacons in time, yet is it before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. But that churches were for a time without Prieſts, (or Elders,) it is more manifeſt out of the epiſtle to Titus, &amp; the fourteenth of the Acts, then that it can be denied. But how long they were ſo, I wil not define: In this matter, I ſuppoſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8306:33"/> the Apoſtle had not at anye time ſo great a regarde of the time, as of the perſons, and their perfections. For it was not for the wiſedome of the Apoſtles, raſhly to lay their hands of any, or to appoint them ouer the church, whom God had not anointed with thoſe graces, which are required in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of the church. Wherefore, when as the churches which were newly conuerted to the faith, did conſiſt but of noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: there was no remedy, but they muſt ſtay a time, vntill they had made triall of their diſpoſitions, and taken notice of their abilities, vnto whom the church-gouernment was to be committed. In the meane while, all things were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, by the vigilant ouer-ſight of the Apoſtles, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts, and ſuch, as they intertained to their ſuccours, as helpers and fellow-labourers.</p>
               <p>No doubt, the Apoſtle Paul is like vnto himſelfe in all his Epiſtles, &amp; therefore it was not hap-hazard, that in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Philippians only, he ſaluteth Biſhops &amp; Deacons, &amp; in none of the reſt. By the which, as we are put out of all doubt, that the church of the Philippians had their Elders and Deacons: ſo are wee left in ſuſpence, for any of the reſt. (If ſo be (as els where) we are to gather of his ſtile, the ſtate of the church.) Here therefore it behoueth the reader to be very attent, that wil learn to know, what churches had their Prieſts, and what not. Is it likely, that hee which ordinarilie accuſtometh to greet ſo louinglie in all Epiſtles, all that hee knew to be indued with any vertue, ſo willingly to comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d al that he knew to be of any deſert in the church, and alſo ſo freely to note all that he knew to be in any defect, (I ſay) is it likely, that of all other, he would haue left the Biſhops and elders vnſaluted? in the epiſtle to the Rom. he ſaluteth many whom albeit he cal his fellow-laborers, yet ar they no wher ſaid to haue borne any ſway in the church of Rome. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth <hi>Aquila</hi> (&amp; the church which was in his houſe) who was now at Corinth, then at Epheſus, &amp; ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at Philippos: neither forgetteth he <hi>Andronicus</hi> &amp; <hi>Vrba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> wherof the one he commendeth, as notable among the Apoſtles, and the other he confeſſeth, as his fellow laborer.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8306:33"/> Theſe and all other, whom hee knew reſiant at Rome, hee deygneth with titles of condign prayſes, becauſe they labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored together with the Apoſtles. And therefore no doubt if ſo be any of them had beene the proper Paſtor of that Church, he would ſurely haue taken ſome knowledge, or made ſome remembraunce of it: As we reade that he did in his Epiſtle to the Philippians, of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and to the Coloſſians, of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> and <hi>Archippus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer when <hi>Paul</hi> came to Rome, we read how he was receiued of the brethren, and of the Elders: the which thing might euen as well haue beene there (if there had beene any ſuch Elders there) as in the fifteenth of the Actes, and the one and twenty alſo, it is well noted, how he was intertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Elders. But by theſe it may appeare, what the ſtate of the Church was at Rome, when the Apoſtle did write vnto them. The like may bee declared out of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Epiſtle to the Corinthians, (that I name not any other) namely, That they had not theyr proper Paſtors, or peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar incumbents, when thoſe Epiſtles were written. For who knoweth not, that <hi>Paul</hi> did write vnto new born Churches, which eyther were then but in the mould, or as yet in theyr nonage? Who beſides <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus, Apollo</hi> &amp; <hi>Lucas, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus, Achaicus</hi> and ſuch like, (whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did ſend to them in common) had no other Elders, nor yet any other Biſhop, but the Apoſtle himſelfe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Churches were not without order, yet ther was not that order, as afterwards they had, when they were not ſet in order, vnder Elders, that had taken orders. In meane ſeaſon, the Apoſtles &amp; Euangeliſts, and other religious tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, did viſit them by turns, as theyr opportunity ſerued. And hence is it, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> doe excuſe themſelues vnto the Corinthians, that they did not viſite them ſo often as they could haue wiſhed. The which was alſo very well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius. Epiphanius aduerſus hereſes,</hi> in the 75. hereſie hath theſe wordes. <hi>When the Goſpell was young the holy Apoſtle wrote according as the matter then ſtood. For where there were Biſhops appointed, he wrote to Biſhops and Deacons. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8306:34"/> could the Apoſtles appoynt all thinges at the firſt. In deed the greateſt neede was of Prieſts, and Deacons, for by theſe two, all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall functions may be diſcharged. But where there was not any man found worthy a Biſhopricke, there they remayned without a Biſhop. But where neede was, and there were that were worthy of it, there were appointed Biſhops. But where there was no great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, ther were not found among them, that might be made prieſts. &amp; ſo they contented themſelues with one Biſhop in that place, &amp;c.</hi> And he addeth: <hi>So the Church receiued the fulnes of hir functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for euery thing had not all things at the first, but in proceſſe of time, thoſe things were prouided, which were requiſite to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of things neceſſary.</hi> Ambroſe vpon the 4. of the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, writeth thus: <hi>In al things the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, doth agree with the order which is now in the Church, becauſe theſe things were written about the beginnings of the Church. For he calleth Timothy alſo a Biſhop, whom he had ordayned a Prieſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt Priestes were called Biſhops; that one going away, the next might ſuccede him.</hi> Thus ſayth Ambroſe: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the writings of the Apoſtles are to be vnderſtood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeaſons in the which they were written. In deede the Apoſtles layd the foundations: but others raiſed the worke; <hi>Paule planted, Apollo watered.</hi> And therefore ſo ſoone as with the time the Church increaſed, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of beleeuers multiplyed, they were not ſufficing for the multitude whome the Lorde himſelfe had ſent: for which cauſe the Apoſtles took vnto themſelues fellow-laborers in the Miniſtery, firſt Deacons, then Prieſts or Elders. Of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are now to ſpeake.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8306:34"/> where is a Paſtor. This is once: that as by the three former names of Apoſtles, Prophets, and Euangeliſts, the Apoſtle ſeemeth to note thoſe, which had an extrordinary vocation from God immediat, and not from men; ſo by theſe two laſt names of Doctors and Paſtors (whether wee take them as both one, or otherwiſe) hee ſeemeth to vnderſtand thoſe, which by men were preferred to the Church. And that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Elders are thoſe, whome <hi>Paul</hi> calleth Paſtors, it ſufficiently appeareth by that in the twentith Chapter of the Actes, where <hi>Paul</hi> intertaining the Elders hee had ſent for from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> telleth them, that they were appointed of god, <hi>Biſhops</hi> to feede the Church. And thereuppon wee alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no Elder or Biſhop in the Church of Chriſt, that is not a Paſtor or feeder.

               <p>
                  <hi>Presbyter</hi> is a Greeke word, and aunſwereth to that which the Hebrewes call <hi>Zachen,</hi> which ſignifyeth not onely an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in yeares, (who for his age is to be reuerenced, but alſo an auncient in the common wealth, who for his place and authority is to be honored: yea it is a title of honour, with the which the Nobles and Magiſtrates of the old Teſtament are graced: from whence alſo it is deriued to the Rectors of the Church in the new Teſtament, who are called Biſhops, by reaſon of their ouerſight and watchfull care; which is a title of work &amp; labor, but the name of Paſtor is a title decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ſpeciall charge &amp; office, ſo called of feeding the Lords flock with the Angel-like food of his heauenly word. Albeit ther are many other titles alſo, common to the ſaid Paſtors in the Scriptures, as that they are called <hi>Stewards, Preſidents, Prelats, Guids, Gouernors, Miniſters,</hi> and ſuch like. The vertue &amp; property of which titles, I will not here ſtand to explaine: it is that you may haue elſe where: Only I will enforce from thence ſuch arguments, as the occaſion ſhall ſerue, and the matter which I handle ſhall require.</p>
               <p>In the meane time you ſhall vnderſtande, that the office of theſe Paſtors, and doctors (albeit ordained of men)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8306:35"/> doth not differ in kinde, from that of the Apoſtles. For the chiefe part of them both, is to inſtruct, exhort, reprehend, and refell the aduerſaryes of the truth, (Beſides the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, a thing no leſſe pertaining to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, then Apoſtles.) Neyther is a Paſtorall ouerſight diſiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticed of that Apoſtolick authority of Eccleſiaſtical cenſure, which remayneth, and is requiſite for the edifying of the Church.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt now, for as much as there is not the ſame, or the like proportion of charge committed to all Elders; there is alſo no ſmal difference among thoſe, whom the Scripture calleth by the ſame name of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Elders. The which ſeeing it muſt be diſcerned, rather by themſelues as they are in deede, then by their names as they are called, let vs alwayes chiefely regard, what they are, then, what they are called; that we may truely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betweene thinges that differ, not ſo much in name as in nature.</p>
               <p>The firſt Elders therefore whome the Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned, were theyr fellow-laborers in the Lord his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, as <hi>Iohn, Marke, Titus, Luke, Timo hy, Demas, Siluanns,</hi> and many others of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we read in the Scriptures. Al the which, by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Miniſters, no otherwiſe then the reſt, who afterwards were placed ouer their ſeuerall Churches. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that which wee read of <hi>Timothy,</hi> wee conceyue of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8306:35"/> the reſt; and therefore that charge which was giuen vnto theſe, was rather prouinciall, then particular: ſeeing they were the aſſociats, and aſsiſtants of the Apoſtles themſelues.</p>
               <p>But when as daily the number of the faithfull increaſed, and the increaſe of Churches was thereby more and more aduaunced, together (as ſupply could be made of able men for the Miniſterie) the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes, (or their aſſociates) inſtalled into particular Churches, particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors: who beeing placed in their wardes (as it were) ſhould not range at large from thence, but vnder the Apoſtles (as faithfull Paſtors) ſhould keep watch and ward ouer the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of the Lorde. And yet they were not ſo inueſted into thoſe their ſeuerall charges, that the ſole and whole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie being demiſed to them, they ſhould rule the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and the charge thereof ſhould thence-forth concerne the Apoſtles no more: but to this ende were they ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that ſeeing the Apoſtles themſelues could not bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies reſident in euery place, there might notwithſtanding (by their good meanes) be nothing wanting in anie place. If twelue men could haue beene ſuffiſing for all Churches, there ſhould neuer haue beene leuied any newe increaſe of other ſeuentie. But when they altogether could not ſerue, to ſerue the turne, both theſe, and they both, had need of more abettors, to helpe them out withall.</p>
               <p>And albeit the Miniſterie of the Goſpell vnder Chriſt, be onely one, as the prieſt-hood of the law vnder <hi>Moſes</hi> was one: yet notwithſtanding, as in one prieſt-hood there were diuers degrees of gouernement, ſo likewiſe in one Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Goſpell, there are (as you haue heard) diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Paſtors. For haue you not ſeene, how of the Lorde himſelfe, there were two degrees of Miniſters ordeined? (&amp; of them the one was ſuperior to the other.) How afterwards of the Apoſtles, there were in like manner ordeyned two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? (for to ſome they gaue in commiſsion the Churches of one whole prouince, and to ſome againe the ſingle rectorie of one onely Church.)</p>
               <p>That <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothie,</hi> had a ſuperior intendencie ouer
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8306:36"/> many Churches, as alſo ouer them, which were alreadie, or were to be preferred thereunto, it is ſufficiently manifeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery indifferent ſenſe. For otherwiſe, why was hee ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently admoniſhed to beware, that he lay not his hands v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any man extemporie? And againe: to what purpoſe is hee ſo cautionately forbidden, to admit any accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an Elder, without the teſtimonie of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? This therefore leadeth vs thus farre, as it were by the hand, that of force wee muſt confeſſe, how that vnder the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, &amp; of the Apoſtles, there were ordeined two degrees of Miniſters, &amp; they of diuers authority, though not of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers titles: vnto whom, albeit the Scripture for the preſent, gaue no proper or diſtinct denomination, yet in good time Poſteritie did it, wel aduiſed. For although the names of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and Biſhop, were commonly giuen to all Miniſters of old, yet preſently vpon the Apoſtles time, the name and title of Biſhop was imparted, as a proper addition to the firſt &amp; chiefe order of Elders. And yet they were not deſtitute of their diſtinction by their more ſacred titles, euen in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time. For did not the Apoſtles themſelues grace the chiefe Elders with the title of their fellow-laborers, &amp; their fellow-labourers with their owne titles? In the which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, we find their poſteritie very ſparing, and that for iuſt cauſe; namely, for that obſequious reuerence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious regard they had of the Apoſtles lately deceaſed; the chiefe inſtruments and ornaments of Gods Church.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8306:36"/> leſſe, then of anie temporall Elders, to play the bugs in the Church (like ſpeciall bailyes) for a ſpurt, and be gone: whereas in the whole ſchoole of the Apoſtles, you ſhall not finde, the worſt Elder, that is not placed in one of the two foreſaid formes. Generally in all Elders, the Apoſtle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thus much; <hi>That they be apt to teach:</hi> And,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>that they may be able to exhort with wholeſome doctrine, and improue them which ſay against it.</hi> If in this nouell kind, we looke for parts agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to theſe: ſure I am, we ſhall neuer finde, that dumbe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of a yeeres grouth, mute to inſtruct, made to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund in the Church, are any where compriſed in this forme.</p>
               <p>As for that gouernment, the Apoſtle numbreth among the giftes of Gods ſpirit, it is to bee vnderſtood indeed of a ſingular and ſupereminent gift. For no doubt the right art of gouernment, is a rare and a religious thing: the which albeit there are ſcarſe anie that will not boldly arrogate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, yet is it truly to be found but in a few. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I rather iudge) this ſo exquiſite a gift of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to be reſerued vnto the more excellent order of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; as namely, the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, and others the principall Miniſters of that time, as were <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie,</hi> and ſuch other, which gouerned many Churches with power Apoſtolike.</p>
               <p>And therefore me thinkes, that they of all other are farre wide, who thinke ſo rare and ſingular a gift of Gods ſpirite, ought to be impropriate to ſo baſe an order of Elders, mute and momentarie, <hi>which gouerne not long, and teach not at all.</hi> Sure I am, that the Apoſtolike Churches, and the ſequel of many yeares after, neuer interteined anie ſuch kinde of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, for Church officers. And had not the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes, and their aſſociates, ſole preheminence ouer the Elders of particular Churches, in the abſolute authority of Church gouernment?</p>
               <p>True it is, I find certaine Sages and Seniours, who did v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſit in counſell with the Prieſts of the olde ſynagogue, who were not Prieſtes; but I reade not of anie in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8306:37"/> Church, of counſell with the Paſtors, but the Paſtors. And in verie deed, in the Apoſtles daies, and many ages after, there were not in <hi>Eſſe</hi> any Chriſtian Magiſtrats, which could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with the Elders of the Church, in matters concerning the Church. As for thoſe Elders and Seniors, whom we read to haue beene ioyned with the Prieſts in councell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, they were the ordinary Magiſtrates of Iſrael, which lawfully could not be ſequeſtred or ſecluded from the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and conſtitutions of the Prieſtes, no more then at this day the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is to bee reſtrained from the Sinods and aſſemblies of the Church. For albeit there bee two kindes of gouernement; one of the Cittie, an other of the Church: yet are they both deriued from one and the ſame author. The which alſo, although they bee executed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a diuers manner, and that the one proceed of God, as he is the creator and moderator of all things, and the other of one and the ſame GOD, as hee is the reſtorer and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of mankind, and each of them haue their ſeuerall ende alſo: yet notwithſtanding, ſeeing the ſame ſocietie is both Church &amp; Cittie, and the authority of them both is drawen from the ſame head: ſo likewiſe are they driuen to one end, and come all to the ſame paſſe. And of this it commeth to paſſe, that they both haue many thinges in common, which cannot eaſily be propounded without a common aſſembly, nor concluded without a generall aſſent.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter hath authoritie from the Lord our Sauiour, to gouerne the Church: the Magiſtrate from the ſame Lord our creator, hath the like ſoueraigntie to rule the Cittie. The which two diuers and diſtinct eſtates, ſo often as they doe friendly conſort together in one vniſone, &amp; direct all their counſels to the ſame end, I ſay ſo long, the Cittie muſt needs thriue, and the Church cannot doe amiſſe. As for anie other Elders in the Church (beſides theſe of the which I haue now ſpoken, and you heard) I would to God ſome man would ſhew me which be they (if there be any ſuch.)

               <p>Doe you not knowe, that the offices of the Church, are gifts of the ſpirit, and as it were talents of the Lord, laid out to loane among men; of the which there muſt one day an account be rendred to the Lorde? I tell you, it is not at the pleaſure of anie ſeruant in the houſe of Chriſt, raſhly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onerate himſelfe of anie office he hath vnder-taken: <hi>He that once putteth his hand to the plough, and afterwards looketh backe, is not fitte for the kingdome of God.</hi> For my part, I could neuer yet read, that there was at anie time in the Church, anie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice temporarie, if it were ordinarie. I admit, that Deacons may afterwards be made Miniſters; but that cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a defection from the office, which is the perfection of the ſame, neither is that offfice forſaken, when in the ſame order a higher is vnder-taken; they fall not from that they were, but riſe to that they were not.

               <p>Such indeed, the Biſhops and Elders in times paſt, tooke in counſel with them, as did alſo of old the auncient Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; And yet <hi>Ambroſe</hi> bringeth them not into any equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page with thoſe, which were Elders in calling, whom he had about him, and who gouerned the Churches vnder him; but he greeueth that ſuch graue and auncient men in yeres, whome the Apoſtle would not haue reprooued any thing roughly, ſhould not remaine in the like eſteeme with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Elders of the Church, as they were of olde.

                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.1,</note> 
                  <hi>Rebuke not an auncient (or an Elder) but exhort him as a father,</hi> hee writeth thus. <hi>That in reuerence of his yeares, an ancient man is to be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with mildnes to goodnes, that hee may the rather take warning: for beeing gentlie admoniſhed, hee will be afraide, least afterwards hee ſhould bee more roughly dealt withall; which were a ſhame for an Elder. For among all nations age is honoured, for which cauſe both the Synagogues of olde, and afterwards alſo the Church, had alwayes certaine auncient men, without whoſe aduiſe nothing was done in the Church. The which by what negligence it was lefte off, I cannot tell, except haplie it were through the ſloth, or rather the pride of ſome Pastors, becauſe they alone would ſeeme to bee ſome thing.</hi> Thus much ſayth <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> who (I dare bee bound for him) thought nothing leſſe, then that anie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Miniſtery, ſet downe by the Apoſtles, was nowe worne out: For himſelfe had Elders, which did alſo rule the Church with him, or vnder him; beſides that, the words doe ſhew as cleare as noone-day, that hee ſpake heere of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, not in office, but in age.</p>
               <p>If any vouchſafe certaine auncients (experienced in many thinges) the ſenate of the Church, I ſay not againſt it; but this I auouch that ſuch (were they all more auncient then <hi>Iaphet</hi>) are not to bee accounted among the Church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Elders, which the Apoſtles ordained. And I dare be bolde further to affirme, that they are in no ſmall errour, who thinke, that the Elders and auncients in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reformed Churches in this our age, are of the ſame ſute with thoſe, whome the Apoſtles ordained in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8306:38"/> of the Actes, and <hi>Paule</hi> ſent for from <hi>Epheſus</hi> in the twentie chapter, Whoſe order and office is deſcribed at large in the Epiſtles to Timothie and Titus.</p>
               <p>I perceiue here the reformation of the Engliſh Church, appointeth in euery place certaine Church officers, which repreſent in ſome ſort thoſe auncients and Elders, and they are commonly called <hi>Church-wardens.</hi> Notwithſtanding theſe come ſhort of that authority in Eccleſiaſticall cenſure, <hi>To excommunicate:</hi> but if any excommunicate perſon, ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly preſſe into the holy aſſembly, they are to endeuour (by the aduiſe of the Miniſter) to remoue him. Their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary office, according to law, is this; To gather &amp; collect, to lay vp, and lay out the rents and reuenews of the church; to keepe the bodie of the Church, and the reſt in repayre, to keepe the Church booke (together with the Miniſter) to admoniſh offendors, and vnruly fellowes, and as for the ſtubborne, infamous, and offenſiue, to preſent them to the Biſhop, or his deputie, &amp; that vpon their othes: furthermore alſo, to note who they are that abſent themſelues from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice, vpon the Saboth, or holy-daies, and to ſet a fine on their heads, according to the law prouided in that caſe: and alſo, to looke that due ſilence, and all other kind of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſeemlines bee obſerued in the time of diuine ſeruice. If the ancient Primatiue Church, had any ſuch kind of Elders, they were not (I am ſure) at any time accounted of our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, among the Elders &amp; Biſhops of our Church: for they alwaies made a difference in the Church, betwene the laike officers, and the Church Miniſters. In <hi>Tertullian</hi> his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, the Elders, which wee reade, were preſent &amp; preſident in chriſtian aſſemblies, were Biſhops and Elders, no temporall men; vnles wee would make him contrary to himſelfe, who iuſtly vpbraided the Heretikes of that time with that fault, That they prophaned Church functions with lay perſons.</p>
               <p>Neither are theſe things ſo ſpoken of me, neither wold I be ſo taken, as if I chalenged thoſe reformed Churches, that vſe ſome ſuch like Seniors (for ſo they ſuppoſe) as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſeemed to wiſh for: I my ſelfe did vſe them, when I ſupplied
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8306:39"/> the place of a Miniſter in ſome reformed Churches. For the tyrannie of Popiſh Biſhops beeing ouerthrowne, when as they which are indeed the true Elders, doe themſelues in like manner ſuſtaine the office of a Biſhop: they could not well take vnto themſelues the intire gouernment of the Church, without ſome ſuſpicion of the like; if no leſſe tyrannie. And therfore it was neceſſarie for them, to ioyne with themſelues certaine godly men out of the whole corps of the Church: for that without the aſſiſtance of their aſſociates, it was not poſsible for them alone, to counter-checke the immodeſtie of bad men, and to bring them into ſome Coram.</p>

So that <hi>Paul</hi> in theſe wordes, reſpecteth the ſingular care of ſome, not the ſingle preaching of all.</p>
               <p>Writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he defineth a Biſhopricke to bee a worke: of the which it followeth, that the greater the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick is, the greater is the <hi>labour,</hi> the greater is the work. If he which is ouer one onely Church, ſhall finde himſelfe ſomewhat to doe: what ſhall we ſay of them, vnto whome the care of many Churches is committed.

               <p>The whole ſum therefore of our aſſertion, reſolueth into thus much: that among the Biſhops or Elders in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which gouerned Churches vnder the Apoſtles, there were diuerſe degrees <hi>in deed,</hi> by what <hi>names</hi> ſoeuer ye pleaſe to call them; of the which ſome were ouer one Church only, and that vnder the direction of an other, and ſome againe ouer many Churches, ſuppliant to none of the ſame order: as it is wel knowen of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the reſt. I know there are many, who in the ſecret preiudice of their foreſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned opinions, wil not ſticke to ſay, that <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the reſt of that forme, were Euangeliſtes, and inueſted

               <p>To whom I aunſwere, that I haue heard ſo in deede, and read it to: but without reaſon or proofe at al, of any credit. For where as <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and chargeth him that he <hi>doe the worke of an Euangeliſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim, 4.5. 1.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8306:41"/> time, is but humaine. Wherefore here (beloued) it is time to looke about vs. For they eaſely auoyd all that wee haue already auowed of the Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; when they aunſwere, that the gouernement Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique was but <hi>temporanie</hi> and momentary, and determined with the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts themſelues, long ſince deceaſed, ſo that now there is no more any one Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another.</p>
               <p>But that the trueth of this queſtion may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, we muſt now haue an eſpeciall eye to all thoſe giftes, which were eſpecially pregnant in the Apoſtles and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, that thereby we may know, what was proper to the Apoſtles and theyr times, and what common to all Paſtors vnto the worlds end. To which end, the firſt thing we are to reuiſe in the Apoſtles, is that theyr extraordinary calling (for they had it immediatly from God,) then alſo, theyr ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Embaſſee and commiſſion without reſtraint, or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Thirdly, that in all things which concerned theyr function, they had a neuer-errant director, (the ſpirite of trueth) who ſuggeſted vnto them, whatſoeuer they before had heard of the Lord, or ſhould otherwiſe be requiſite for them to know. And the laſt thing, is theyr <hi>power Apostolique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe, the firſt three were neceſſary, for laying the ground-worke of Churches, vppon the which others ſhould build: the which vnleſſe they had been ſemented (as it were) with the more ſure ioynts and ſtrongeſt ſinewes of Gods ſpirite, what ſoeuer ſhould haue ben rayſed &amp; reared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon by others, muſt needs haue reeled, and ruined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſame. As for the gift of miracles, I ſtand not vpon that, ſeeing that was beſtowed vpon many other of the faithfull alſo, as it pleaſed God. Of all theſe gifts, they could communicate nothing vnto theyr ſucceſſors, beſides the <hi>Miniſtery of the Goſpell:</hi> The which ſeeing it was inherent in the <hi>power Apoſtolique,</hi> they ſurrendered that alſo to theyr ſubſecutors: and that, becauſe it is a thing neceſſary, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the increaſe, but alſo for the continuance of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For without the word preached, the Sacraments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8306:41"/> and the Church gouerned, there can no Church well continue. Wherefore as the preaching of the worde, and the vſe of the Sacraments was not giuen to the Church, onely for the Apoſtles time, but that they might continue vnto the age to come, euen to the worlds end: So likewiſe the forme of gouernement, which was ordayned of God, and deliuered of the Apoſtles, and confirmed of the fathers, ought to remayne and continue in like ſort. But that forme had Paſtors inferior and ſuperior, and therefore that alſo is to be retained in the Church of God. Neither doth <hi>the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Miniſtery</hi> hinder, why there may not be an <hi>inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the policie</hi> of the Church. In the olde law there was one Prieſthood equall and alike to al the Prieſts: &amp; yet were ther diuerſe degrees of Prieſts in reſpect of gouernment, and in an equall order of Prieſthood, there was a not equall Honor of gouernement. Neyther is it preiudiciall to vs, that theyr Prieſthood was Leuiticall and typical, ſeeing the ſtate &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement which was among the Prieſts and Leuits, did not ſo much reſpect any intricate type, as a well ordered ſtate: that al things might be done decently and in due order. Wherefore for as much as God himſelfe was author of that policy and gouernment, in the which Leuits were ſubdued to Leuits, and Prieſts to Prieſts: it ought not to be recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any humaine conſtitution, where a Miniſter is ſubiect to a Miniſter, and one Paſtor to an other: For that is no more vnlawfull at this day, then it was at that.</p>

Your kinde of gouernment ſhal be diuerſe from that which is proper to Princes, whether you take thoſe which are more tyrannous and truculent ouer theyr people, or thoſe which in theyr gouernment, are more milde and moderate, accor-to their lawes. Doth this ſence or ſentence take away that difference of perſons, which the law of nature and the rule of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t do preſcribe? If ther be any place in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell (and ther are many) which may be cited for the <hi>ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Miniſters, this is one. For vnleſſe the Lord had meant that in the gouernment of the Church, there ſhould be ſome greater then the reſt, he would neuer haue ſayd, Hee which is <hi>greateſt</hi> among you let him be as the leaſt; he might haue made ſhort worke of al, and as ſoon haue ſayd, There is none <hi>first</hi> among you, none <hi>greateſt,</hi> none <hi>chiefe.</hi> But he that is <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> among you (ſaith he) let him be <hi>as</hi> the leaſt, and he which is higheſt, <hi>as</hi> he that miniſtreth. Which were no aduice, wher there is none higher then another. Where all ſhall be alike, what need there any precept, how he which is greateſt amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them ſhould behaue himſelfe? The meaning therfore of this precept is this: How much any of you is ſuperior to the reſt, ſo much more ſubmiſſe ſhall he carry himſelfe towards the reſt. For albeit all the Apoſtles were of the ſame order and power, yet the difference of age, and diuerſity of gifts was great among them, and therefore it could not be, but that they which had receiued greater gifts of the Lord, ſhoulde receiue greater countenance of men.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Chapter to the Galathians doth ſufficiently declare this, where he ſheweth that he had conferred of the Goſpell with them, which ſeemed <hi>to bee ſomewhat,</hi> the which he foorthwith repeating againe, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that there were certayne of theſe Apoſtles of <hi>chiefe

Such was the mildnes and moderation of his ſpirite; hee would not goe about to make that equal in-equality odious, of the which the Lord himſelfe was the author. For hee well knew, that neyther he which had receiued fiue talents, ought to thinke he hath but two, and much leſſe, he which hath but two, to compare himſelfe with him that hath fiue. And in deede, can there be any reaſon giuen, why there ſhould be rather an inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in gouernement, then in other gifts? or doe men abuſe authority onely, to maintayne theyr tyranny? Doubtleſſe it is not greatly materiall, with what giftes a man enthronize himſelfe Pope ouer his brethren; whether for his fine witte, or deepe knowledge, or ſmooth eloquence, or any other ſuch inward vertue: Whether for the holines of life, or ſtrictnes of faſts, or largenes of almes, or any ſuch outward complement: or elſe for his wealth, his worſhip, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour authority. As for the aunſwere of our Sauiour it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth far and neare: neyther is it to be referred to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles alone, as if it were onely forbidden an Apoſtle, to domineere ouer an Apoſtle, but it ſtretcheth it ſelfe vnto al other.

By all the which it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that by that prohibition of violent dominion which Kings may vſe ouer theyr ſubiects, the power of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church is not inhibited, by the which one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is eminent in authority ouer another, no more then the power of the Paſtor is thereby intercepted, which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ought to be ouer his people.

               <p>There are two words, which being not well taken, may be very offenſiue, namely, <hi>Temporarie</hi> and <hi>extraordinary:</hi> For it is to be vnderſtood, that there are not ioyntly to be giuen alike to the whole function Apoſtolick, and euery part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

And verelie if the <hi>Apoſtolique authority</hi> had bin Temporarie, that alſo had bene a perſonal gift, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler: neither would they haue preſumed to haue taken themſelues companions and co-partners in that Apoſtolik charge, to the which themſelues only were appointed of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8306:44"/> Lord. But when as they knew, that their office, &amp; whatſoeuer authoritie they had receaued, was rather giuen to the whole church, then to their ſole ſelues; they therevpon were bolde, to make others, ioynt partners with them in their Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like power, whom they alſo knew ſhould be their ſucceſſors. Neither in nature, could ſo great a worke bee finiſhed of ſo few labourers: and therfore alſo the commandement of the Lord, could no further bind the Apoſtles, then for the terme of their mortalitye: in the which time, the Lorde did not purpoſe to determine, either the promiſe of his helpe, or the preaching of his word.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles then had need of many helpers in the Lord, and fellow-labourers for the buſines of the Lord: the which when they could not accompliſh themſelues, they left their poſteritie to finiſh that, which themſelues could not effect. Had the Apoſtles carried their commiſſion to heauen with them, and beſides the priuate care of perticular Churches, the Biſhops (whome the Apoſtles left their ſucceſſours) had thought the further propagation of the goſpel did nothing pertaine to them: I doubt me, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fines of Chriſt his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had neuer bene enlarged to ſo great a monarchie as it is. What neede I remember you of the rare and memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble examples, of the thriſe reuerend fathers in the Primatiue church? With what ſerious ſtudie, with what earneſt deſire, with what conſtant endeuour, and laſt of al, with what great labours, and many ſtreaming ſhowers of the bloud of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, were the churches of olde planted, watered, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? It is a thing better knowen and commended, then that I need to repeat it, or themſelues to repent it.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding there be ſome in theſe daies, which take vp but to ſhrewdly this ſentence of ours: as if it were ſome Anabaptiſticall fancie, when it is ſaid, that the Church hath at this day, if not Apoſtles, yet Apoſtolique Miniſters: but as for the fancie, (if Anabaptiſticall) let themſelues looke to that, leaſt they take themſelues by the noſe. For my part, I would but know, whether the goſpel yet at this day, now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a 1500. yeares, be come to the eares of all Nations.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8306:45"/> In the meane time, let them conſider howe many nations, (whom the Apoſtles neuer ſaw) by the paines and preaching of godlie Paſtors, (who in this labour ſucceeded the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) haue receiued the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I will not nowe ſtand to tell them, onely this I conclude, that the commaund and commiſsion of preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, ſtandeth yet in his ful ſtrength and force in the church of God, and ſhuld, ſo long as there is any nation, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Lord. That at this day there is none ſent by the churches of Chriſt, to the nations which haue not knowen Chriſt, it is not long of the lacke of ſufficient power to ſend, but of ſufficient perſons to be ſent, or at leaſt wiſe, of a better zeal to adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the kingdom of Chriſt. Indeed no man ought to tempt the Lord: Did not himſelfe forbid his Apoſtles to ſtir one foot out of Ieruſalem, to diſcharge their duty before they had receiued the holy Ghoſt? So requiſite is it, that a man bee throughly furniſhed for ſo great an enterpriſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he vndertake it. And therefore, becauſe the iudgement of one man may be ouer-weening and deceiued, (eſpecially if he may be his owne iudge) it is requiſite, that the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the church in that caſe be expected. But here is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an <hi>Authority Apoſtolique:</hi> the which if the Church haue not, (although it haue fit men) neither hath it the power to ſend. For who can giue that to another, which hee hath not himſelfe? Whoſoeuer therefore is ſent (whether you pleaſe to call him an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or an <hi>Euangeliſt;</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop,</hi>) hee hath need of the like, and no leſſe power then <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had in the like, and no leſſe charge.</p>
               <p>This therefore is the authoritie which is aſsigned to the church by the <hi>Keies:</hi> the which the Lord our Sauiour gaue, not ſo much to <hi>Peter</hi> and his collegiats, as to the Church it ſelfe: ſo that of right it maye doe that at this daye, which it could of old; namely, wher occaſion ſerueth to giue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion vnto ſufficient men, the publiſhing of the Goſpell, with <hi>Authoritie Apoſtolique.</hi>

For by reaſon (as it is thought) of Biſhops and Arch-biſhops, Primats, and Metropolitanes, which haue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Apoſtles and the Euangeliſts, there is now ſome controuerſie moued for that. And verely I haue oftentimes wondered with my ſelfe, what it is that ſhould make anie learned or religious man thinke, that the office of Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes, is ceaſed in the Church, and that at this day there are none poſſeſſed of any <hi>authoritie Apostolike,</hi> to whom the other Elders ought to ſupply in the gouernance of the Church: and I wonder the more, that there bee any that ſhould thinke the <hi>power Apostolike,</hi> a thing ſo <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,</hi> as if it were not poſsible, that it ſhould be deuolued to their poſteritie.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Church hath not continued thoſe names a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs: but is that ſufficient to prooue, that with thoſe titles, the authority alſo is ſurceaſed? Firſt, if a man would but well marke the latter daies of the Apoſtles (of <hi>Paule</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially) he ſhould find, that the <hi>Apostolike gouernment</hi> could not poſsibly end with the Apoſtles. For by thoſe things the ſacred Scripture doth teſtifie of <hi>Paule,</hi> wee may iudge of the reſt, who no doubt, were no leſſe carefull for the good of the Church, euen to their laſt gaſpe, whereſoeuer it pleaſed God to tranſlate them out of this life: But the ſecond Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8306:46"/> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> (indited about the laſt of his daies) doth witneſſe abundantly, what an vniuerſall care hee had euen then of the Churches. There hee maketh mention of his fellow-labourers, whereof ſome he had ſent to goe vnto diuers Churches, and ſome hee ſent for to come vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; that beeing now readie to flit out of this life, he might giue them his laſt charge of all things, concerning the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Church, and the furniſhing of that building him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had left vnfiniſhed.</p>
               <p>This his laſt will and Teſtament hee left with them. The which had beene to no purpoſe, had the <hi>power Apostolike</hi> died with him, or had the authoritie of that their legacie beene compelled within the circuit of euery particular pariſh. For they all, whom <hi>Paul</hi> there remembreth (as <hi>Titus, Marke, Luke, Creſcens, Tithicus,</hi> and <hi>Timothie</hi> himſelfe) were aſſociate with <hi>Paule</hi> in his <hi>Apostolike ſea,</hi> as vnto whoſe ſeuerall charge, hee had demiſed many and ſundry Churches; The which if it were not free for them (with that recreant <hi>Demas</hi>) to caſt vp, and giue ouer, while <hi>Paul</hi> yet liued, how much leſſe, after he was dead? Wherefore now they were made, and remaine his heires (as before they were his peeres) of his <hi>Apostolike paines and praeheminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the other Apoſtles had alſo their conſorts and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiats in their Apoſtolike charge, vnto whom (themſelues diſcontinuing this life) they demeaned the no leſſe care of the Churches with the like authoritie, there was neuer wiſe man that doubted of it. And furthermore, that their lawfull authoritie, with the which they proſecuted and perſeuered in the Lord his affaires, could no more be extinguiſhed with them, then it was aboliſhed with the Apoſtles (ſo long as there was any church remaining.) But as they ſucceeded the Apoſtles, ſo had they their ſucceſſors: vpon whom if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues did not beſtow the power they had receiued, the Church did; <hi>which is heire generall of the power Apostolike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But goe to nowe: let vs imagine (if there can bee ſuch a conceit) that it is not ſo, as I haue ſaide: let vs ſuppoſe alſo for a while, that the Apoſtles left all vnto Paſtors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

Did their death fal out ſo pat, that euerie Church had their Paſtors and Doctors, and that none of them was left out of faſhion, (I meane without their <hi>Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi>) as were ſomtime the Churches of <hi>Creet</hi> vnder the Apoſtle <hi>Paule?</hi> Who then followed the work that was vnfiniſhed?

In whome it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that they ſhould haue the like authority with that, which <hi>Titus</hi> &amp; <hi>Timothie</hi> receiued of the Apoſtles. That ſome heere flie vnto their old ſtarting hole of <hi>extraordinarie calling,</hi> when they are called vppon with theſe reaſons; they haue ſmall reaſon. For, an ordinarie Miniſterie beeing eſtabliſhed in the Church, it is as badly, as boldly done of them, and it will proue but an euill example to others, to alleadge an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary calling,</hi> vnleſſe they could make ſome certaine profe thereof.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if we would but a litle more attentiuely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and conſider, what the ſtate of the Churches was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out the world, when the Apoſtles departed from hence, wee ſhould ſoone find that in many places they left well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Churches, in the which there was nothing a wanting,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8306:48"/> that is, which had there one Biſhop ouer them, (as were the ſeuen Churches of Aſia, vnto whome the ſpirit of the Lorde ſpeaketh in the Reuelation:) and again we ſhould find ſome other Churches, as yet not finiſhed and throughly faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which wanted many thinges to their perfection, ſome more, ſome leſſe, according to the time, the place, the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; ſcarcitie of the people, which had giuen their names to Chriſt. And beſides all this, wee ſhall finde innumerable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether the Apoſtles could not come, where were no Churches at all. But whatſoeuer, or of what manner ſoeuer they were, they were all dependant vppon the Apoſtles go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment: whome if no man did ſucceede with like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, it muſt needes bee, that they were all left as widdowe Churches and Orphans; which is an abſurd thing to ſay. But if wee ſhall ſay, that they chaunged that manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, with the which they were acquainted vnder the Apoſtles: how could that poſsiblie bee permitted, without the great miſchiefe and miſerie of all thoſe Churches?</p>
               <p>Of theſe things therefore I inferre, That there was left of the Apoſtles <hi>Authoritie Apostolike</hi> to their ſucceſſors, whom they had diſpoſed ouer many Churches: and that, partly for the eſtabliſhing of ſuch Churches as were throughly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and partly, for the finiſhing of ſuch as were left not throughly formed, and partly alſo for the planting of newe, where as yet there was none founded. And this was the cauſe, why <hi>Paule</hi> beeing ſhortly to take his leaue of his life, ſent <hi>Creſcens</hi> into Galatia, and <hi>Titus</hi> into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and ſent for <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> to make their repaire vnto himſelfe. Euen as the Lord himſelfe, being now readie to giue vp this life, prouided for his Diſciples; in like manner, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tooke great care for thoſe Churches, which were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and were to bee gathered from among the Gentiles; otherwiſe, how ſhould the Churches haue receiued their ſo great increaſe after the Apoſtles? Verely, it is with teares to bee lamented, that their holy Apoſtolike zeale is at this day ſo cooled amongſt vs, that no man ſo much as once thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of publiſhing the Goſpell, vnto Nations altogether
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8306:48"/> eſtraunged from the faith of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But now, ſeeing there were manie Churches lefte of the Apoſtles but newe begun, and more, not yet begun, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that power they had receyued of the Lord, the work of the Gentiles conuerſion which was begun by them, was to be followed to the ende. Of the which it followeth, that the <hi>Apostolike power,</hi> giuen of the Lord for the edifiying of his Church, doth yet remaine in the Church. And thoſe parts of <hi>Apostolike gouernment,</hi> as they were giuen of old to certain ſingular Biſhops, ſo are they to be giuen at this day, where they are not giuen, and ſo are they to remaine, where they are giuen. If any man deſire ſome reformation to bee had in that kind, for my part I am not againſt it. The diſpoſing of this power, the Church hath, as it alwayes had; yet ſo, as where the Lord hath giuen a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, hee bee not left out, nor looſe his part. For they doubtleſſe are thoſe Seniors, Auncients and Elders, of the which there is ſo often mention in the Bible: whom we read to haue beene ioyned of old with the Prieſts and Leuites in weightie matters: for they are in ſtead of the whole people.</p>

Neyther is it a ſmal preſumption to abrogate that, which hath beene receyued with ſo greate and vniuerſall conſent; from the which to reuolt, beſides that it is in it ſelfe an vncouth declination of a conceit gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

Among the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which for their antiquity are called the Apoſtles, wee read this that followeth: <hi>It becommeth the Biſhops of euery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to know, who is the chiefe among them, which is to bee accounted as it were the head, without whoſe opinion theſe ought to do nothing of any great moment, but that euerie man doe thoſe things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto his owne pariſh, and the villages which are of the ſame. Neither let himſelfe doe any thing without the knowledge of all: for ſo there ſhall be concord, and God ſhall be glorified through our Lord in his holy ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Canon (a worde or two tranſlated) is renued in the Councell of Antioch, in theſe wordes: <hi>The Biſhops which are in ſeuerall prouinces ought to know, that he which is Biſhop in the Metropolitane Cittie, hath charge alſo of the whole prouince, for that they which haue any buſineſſe, recourſe from all places to the Metropolis or mother Cittie. Wherefore it ſeemeth expedient, that hee excell the reſt in honour, and that the other Biſhops doe nothing of anie great moment without him (according to the auncient decree of our Fathers) but onely thoſe things which pertaine vnto their owne precincts, &amp; the Pariſhes ſubiect to the ſame. For let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Bishop haue authoritie ouer his owne prouince, and let him go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the ſame according to his owne deuotion: and let him haue charge of the whole prouince which is ſubiect to his Cittie, that hee may create Priestes and Deacons, and diſpoſe all things with iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: beſides this, let him doe no other thing without the Bishop of the mother Church, neyther hee himſelfe without the opinion of the rest.</hi> In which Canon renewed and reeſtabliſhed, I obſerue two thinges: the firſt is, the Antiquitie of the Canon; the other is, That the prouince was not alwaies committed to the Biſhop of the Metropolitane Cittie; ſeeing a cauſe is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, why Eccleſiaſticall controuerſies are to be preſented to the Biſhop of the Metropolitane Cittie, rather then to any other: of the which ſeeing the Apoſtles Canon made no mention, the firſt Fathers ſeemed not alwaies to haue had that reſpect of the ſaid Metropolis.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:8306:49"/>
               <p>The antiquitie of this cuſtome, is ſufficiently declared in the ſeuenteenth chapter of the <hi>Nicene</hi> councel, as followeth: <hi>Let the auncient cuſtome preuaile, which was in</hi> Egypt, Lybia, <hi>and</hi> Pentapolie, <hi>that the Biſhops of Alexandria haue an excellency &amp; ſupreme dignitie ouer all theſe: Seeing that this is alſo the cuſtome with the Biſhop of Rome. In like manner, at</hi> Antioch, <hi>and in other Prouinces, primacie, dignitie, honor, authoritie, is giuen vnto thoſe Churches. But this is moſt plaine: that if any man he made a Biſhop, without the conſent of the Metropolitane, The great Councell defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that he ought not to be a Biſhop.</hi> Thus goeth the Law, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were it anye great matter to confirm the ſame, with the Canons of other Councels, and Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories. But by this it may appeare, what was the iudgement of all thoſe auncient fathers concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>That ſome are of opinion, that Patriarches and Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were firſt created of the Nicene councell, or (as ſome will haue it) of the firſt Conſtantinopolitane Councell; their opinion is their errour: for the Nicene councell, which was called about the twentie yeare of Conſtantine the great, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, that it enacteth no new thing, when it commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the olde cuſtome ſhould bee continued: ſo that, it was no new thing at that time, for ſome one Biſhop to haue ſuperiour authority ouer the reſt of his brethren, his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie being limited by certaine lawes. But that ſome argue, how that to be preſident ouer diuers Prouinces, &amp; to haue charge of them, belongeth to the office of an Apoſtle, and an Euangeliſt; and that one and the ſame man cannot bee an Apoſtle and an Euangeliſt and a Biſhoppe, for that theſe are diſtinct offices: I may anſwere them, that neuer yet any before theſe our daies, did euer either ſo think, or write. The Fathers haue teſtified in their writinges, what they receiued of their fore-fathers, that <hi>Iames</hi> an Apoſtle was ordained of the reſt, Biſhoppe of Ieruſalem. The which thing alſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue bene done vpon iuſt and neceſſarie occaſion: namely, for the neceſſary good of the Church. For when as that was the mother of all other churches, &amp; that the Iews reſorted thither out of al the parts of the world, it ought not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8306:50"/> but to haue an Apoſtle reſiant among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo long as might be: who might reſolue the brethren in ſuch doubtes, as were likely to ariſe among them. Although indeede, to pilgrime through diuers regions, &amp; to preach the goſpel, is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appertaining to the office of an Apoſtle: ſo that they may not abide in one place, but where neceſſitie requireth.</p>
               <p>As therefore the Apoſtles diſcharged the duty of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> when as they took vpon them the particuler charge of ſome on ſpecial church (namely, when the neceſſity of the church vniuerſall did ſo require,) neither did thinke they did anye thing therin; contrarie to their Apoſtolik calling, ſo likewſe if that which wholy pertaineth to the Apoſtles, be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the Biſhops, it need not ſeme a thing either vnreaſonable, or not profitable, when the good order of church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth require the ſame. But whereas the Canon ſayth, that we ſhould keepe the old cuſtome, not the Lords inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it may ſeme that the power of Patriarks, crept into the church of a contrarie cuſtome, rather then of any diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. I anſwere, that the canon doth not gaine-ſay, that the power Apoſtolique in church-gouernment was not left vnto the church, of the Apoſtles: but that, beſides or aboue the reſt, theſe or they, ſhuld inioy it (as namely he of <hi>Antioch Alexandria, Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome,</hi>) that indeed was of the mere cuſtome, and at the ſole diſpoſition of the church. For thoſe particular Biſhops did not receiue their Apoſtolique power immediatly from GOD, as did the Apoſtles, but from the church and by the church; the which as it is not reſtrained to any certaine ſituate places or perſons, citties, or Biſhops: ſo neither is the <hi>autority Apoſtolik.</hi> Who doubteth but that the Nicen cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, or any other like to that, might haue tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Patriarkie of the Romain BB. to ſome other place, &amp; haue giuen it to the BB. of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> or of <hi>Aquiline,</hi> for good cauſe, if their had bene any? The like I ſay of the Patriarks of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But that the councels of Biſhops had this authority, they declared then ſufficiently, when as they made him of <hi>Constantinople</hi> com-peer in all things with him of <hi>Rome.</hi> By the which alſo it may euidently apeare, that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8306:50"/> the prerogatiue of the <hi>power Apoſtolique,</hi> was not giuen by ſucceſſion, but as it was beſt befitting the commodity of the church, by thoſe eſpecial cities. And therfore, in that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non giueth that to cuſtome, it doth not therby take from it the <hi>diuine inſtitution.</hi> But that I may return to the next ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the reſt whom ſacred writ recordeth, were ioyned with the Apoſtles as aſſiſtants, that they were Biſhops, &amp; had charge of many churches, the moſt ancient and authentike traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on approoueth the ſame: neither are thoſe thinges ſo far at variance betweene themſelues, as ſome would haue them, <hi>to be a Biſhop,</hi> &amp; <hi>to do the worke of an Apoſtle,</hi> or <hi>an Euangelist.</hi> For this is the common conſent of all the fathers, that the office of a Biſhop, and an Apoſtle or Euangeliſt are all one, onely that the office of the one is more ample, and auguſtious. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> in his 10. epiſtle writeth thus. <hi>The Deacons ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, the Lord himſelf did chuſe Apoſtles, that is Biſhops &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats: but the Apoſtles themſelues ordeined them Deacons, after hee was receiued vp into heauen.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Cyprian;</hi> out of whoſe words we may learne, that a <hi>Biſhoprick is</hi> an <hi>Apostleſhip,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> is a kind of <hi>biſhopricke.</hi> Herevpon the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in the Acts, calleth the <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> of <hi>Iudas</hi> a <hi>biſhopricke.</hi> And in like maner ſpeaketh <hi>Auguſtine. For no man is ignorant</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that our Sauior ordeined biſhops in the church. For before he aſcended into heuen, he layd his hands vpon his Apoſtles, &amp; made them biſheps.</hi> And <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon that in the 4. to the <hi>Epheſians, ſome were giuen to the church Apoſtles:</hi> writeth thus. <hi>The Apostles are</hi> BB. <hi>but the Prophets are expounders of the ſcriptures, which may now be called Priests. For in a</hi> BB <hi>all the orders are contained, becauſ he is firſt a prieſt, who is chiefe of ths priests, and a Prophet, &amp; an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt, to the furniſhing of the reſt of the offices of the church. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> alſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 1. to <hi>Tim.</hi> cap. 3. ſaith thus. <hi>Of old they called the ſame men Priests and</hi> BB. <hi>but thoſe that are now called</hi> BB. <hi>they then called Apostles: but long ſince, they left the name of Apoſtles, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were indeed apoſtles: but the additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of</hi> BB. <hi>they impoſed vpon ſuch, as of old were called</hi> Apoſtles: <hi>ſo was Epaphroditus the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>of the Philip, &amp; ſo Titus of the Cretenſians, &amp; Timothy of Aſia.</hi> All the fathers which ſucceeded the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8306:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> of opinion, that the forme of gouernement they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Apoſtles, ſhould euer haue bene altered or exau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate: the which verelye they could neuer haue perſwaded themſelues, had they knowen, that the gouernement of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and Timothie, had bene but <hi>Temporarie,</hi> and <hi>Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> But is it credible, nay is it poſſible, that Timothie &amp; Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and others, vnto whome the like prouince was demiſed, ſhould be ignoraunt of this themſelues? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that in the 44. Pſalme, <hi>Inſtead of thy Fathers, thou ſhalt haue children,</hi> ſheweth that our Biſhoppes inherited the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as children their fathers. And were it not a point of frontles and vngracious in ſolencie to deny, that our fathers had their Biſhops and Prelats, euen from the Apoſtles times, and a part of needles and ſuperfluous diligence, to proue a thing ſo manifeſt: I might eaſilie, and would willingly ſtaie vpon the citing &amp; ſummoning of many more fathers, vntil we were fully compaſſed with a cloud of witneſſes. But this is not the queſtion: but rather it is nowe doubted, whether the ordinance of Biſhops bee of God, or of men, as an order that ſlipt into the church, rather of humaine cuſtome, then diuine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution.

               <p>This is without queſtion and beyond all exception, that all the auncient autentike fathers, (ſo many as held the right faith) were of this beliefe, that in this onely plot, they did follow the <hi>Apoſtolique tradition,</hi> and <hi>diuine inſtitution.

And therefore where there were
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8306:52"/> Bishops appoynted, he wrote to Bishops and Deacons: (neyther could the Apostles doe all at once. But they had preſent vſe of Priests &amp; Deacons: For by thoſe two all Eccleſiaſticall functions are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) But where there were not any found worthy a Bishopricke, there the place was voyd of a Bishop, but where neede was, and there were that were worthy, there they placed Bishops. But where as ther were not many, there were not many to be found among them to be made Priests, and therfore they contented themſelues with a Bishop onely in that place: But it is not poſſible, that a Bishop shoulde bee without a Deacon and the Apoſtle had an eſpeciall care of that, that he should not be without his Deacons. And thus the Church recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the fulnes of his functions, according as the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time and place did require.

And therefore <hi>Epiphanius</hi> very well inferreth thus: <hi>So likewiſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>are thoſe things which are written in the Apostle, vntill the Church be enlarged, vntill it come to her ripe years, vntil it be moſt perfectly preyzed with the or-nature of wiſedome, by the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt. Epiphanius</hi> perceyued that there were many things wanting, and that al things were not in theyr perfect temper, &amp; that after a time, one and the ſame man was not both Prieſt and Biſhop, as it well appeared by that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writ to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was a Biſhop: <hi>Againſt a Prieſt or Elder receiue no accuſation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out two or three witneſſes:</hi> He ſayd not to any Elder; receyue no accuſation againſt a Biſhop, &amp;c. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in like manner, mightily confirmeth this the cenſure and ſentence of <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who alſo muſtereth this error of <hi>Aerius</hi> among the mid-ranke of olde confuſed Hereſies.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which is obiected out of <hi>Hierome,</hi> vppon the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> namely, <hi>that Biſhops are greater then Prieſts, rather by the cuſtome of men, then the conſtitution of God &amp;c.</hi> I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: that it was the priuate opinion of <hi>Hierome,</hi> conſenting with <hi>Aerius,</hi> diſſenting from the worde of God. Wherefore we are now diligently to examin his reaſons, for that his aſſertion, leaſt wee might ſeeme without cauſe to haue forſaken him.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore are his wordes: <hi>Before that (through the inſtigation of Satan) there were parts taking in the Church, and the people ſayd, I holde of</hi> Paul, <hi>I of</hi> Apollo, <hi>I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were gouerned by the common conſent of Eldres: but after that once euery man thought thoſe that he baptiſed, were his owne, and not Chriſts: it was decreede throughout the whole worlde, that one choſen from among the</hi> Prieſts <hi>ſhould be placed ouer the reſt, vnto whome the whole care of the Church ſhould appertaine, and by whom al occaſion of Sciſme ſhould be taken away, &amp;c.</hi> That here he ſaith, how that at the beginning, the Churches were gouerned by the <hi>common counſell of the Elders:</hi> I will not greatly ſtand with him: and yet that proueth not, that the Biſhops were not afterwards preferred by the <hi>Lord his inſtitution.</hi> For then might we not as well ſay and with as good reaſon; that the Elders the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and the Doctors which the Apoſtles crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were not according to the Lord his inſtitution, becauſe at the firſt the Church was gouerned of the Apoſtles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Deacons,</hi> when as yet there were neyther <hi>Elders</hi> nor <hi>Deacons.</hi> But that the Apoſtles themſelues gouerned the Churches by themſelues (and ſome other theyr coadiutors) before there were any Elders, there is no man but knoweth,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8306:53"/> or may learne to know out of the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whoſoeuer is of any iudgement (or hath not his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment blinded) may eaſely gather of the thing it ſelfe, that in thoſe beginnings, while yet the Churches might bee viſited euer and anone of the Apoſtles themſelues, and theyr aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats, ſo long it was not needeful they ſhould annoint any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops ouer the Churches; the Elders might ſerue the turne: Who alſo (ſo long as there were no other beſides the Apoſtles) might likewiſe be called <hi>Biſhops.</hi> So alſo I confeſſe, that there was a time, when the Churches were gouerned by the <hi>common counſell of the people,</hi> as in <hi>Creete</hi> (before the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Elders) and at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and at <hi>Rome:</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hauing theyr Elders (as at <hi>Philipos</hi> and at <hi>Epheſus</hi>) were then ruled by their <hi>more ſacred counſel;</hi> but yet vnder the care and ouerſight of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Euangelists.</hi> Wherfore hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it followeth not of all this, that rhe Apoſtles (as God afforded able men) did not prefer ouer ſeueral Churches ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Biſhops, &amp; them ouer the other Elders; that they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in place of the Apoſtles, might performe thoſe very ſame things, which the Apoſtles them ſelues would, if they could eyther haue liued alwayes, or haue been euery where reſident. But in deede, what need had they of Biſhops, ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as the Apoſtles themſelues diſcharged the duty of Biſhops? And yet when as in the whole world, the number of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did daily increaſe, ſo that the Apoſtles could not ſtay in one place, nor goe to all places: of force (and as ſoone as neede was) they created <hi>Biſhops,</hi> vnto whome they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that charge (as were <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> and many other) no doubt with the ſame power, and according to the ſame diuine inſtitution of God, by the which before they crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elders.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, how that Biſhops became greater then Elders, <hi>of cuſtome</hi> rather then of any <hi>diuine inſtitution;</hi> it hath no ſemblaunce of truth. Which challenge I make good vppon him, firſt from the time, when he ſaith this cuſtome began. <hi>Before</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>through the inſtigation of the diuell they began to make ſects in the Church, aad it was ſayd among the people;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8306:54"/> I holde of</hi> Paul, <hi>I of</hi> Apollo, <hi>I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>the Churches were ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the common counſell of Elders, &amp;c.</hi> But now thoſe facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons began vnder the Apoſtles; and therefore, that cuſtome began in good time, and the Apoſtles themſelues for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding of ſciſme altered (if not abrogated) the Lord his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The which (me thinks) were more then abſurde to ſay. Our Sauiour no doubt, who is the wiſedome of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, knew much better then the Apoſtles, what was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and commodious for the preuenting of ſciſme. Whome as it did not beſeeme, to ſeeme more wiſe then their maſter; ſo was it not theyr partes, for the default of one Church, to alter Gods inſtitution. Againe how knewe <hi>Hierome,</hi> that before thoſe ſciſmes brake foorth, the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth had theyr <hi>Elders,</hi> by whoſe councell they were ruled? It is more likely by <hi>Paul</hi> his Epiſtles (all circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) that they had as then none eſpeciall and peculiar <hi>Elders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man come in and ſay, that theſe thinges happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the Apoſtles time, and that <hi>Hierome</hi> did not ſo much reſpect the Church of Corinth, as diuerſe others (and therefore ſpeaketh not of Corinth, but of the people) who were fallen into diuerſe ſciſmes; I come vppon him againe, and tell him, it is not enough for him to ſay ſo, but it muſt bee proued out of approued Hiſtories, what thoſe ſciſms were, and how, and where, and when they began; and how from that time, this foreſayd cuſtome began. We read in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> of ſeuen Angels, the Prelates of ſeuen Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of the which one was <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the which (as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt) had many <hi>Biſhops</hi> before that time (as were alſo at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippos</hi>) all which, as I haue ſhewed, were <hi>Elders</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that in the originall of the Church, there was a time, when they had nor Elders, nor Biſhops, beſides the Apoſtles themſelues, the Euangeliſts and theyr fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers: (as in Creete) (for the beginnings of all were alike.) Shall wee therefore ſay, that thoſe Elders were ſet ouer the Church of cuſtome, not of any diuine conſtitution, becauſe the Churches at the firſt, vnder the Apoſtles gouerned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8306:54"/> without Elders? or, that after they had abuſed that their popular kinde of gouernaunce, that thereuppon the gouernment was committed to the councell of Elders, of <hi>cuſtome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer if this argument were good, we might argue in like manner, againſt the inſtitution of Deacons, and ſay they were not ordained according to any <hi>diuine inſtitution,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in the beginning there were none of that order: namely, ſo long as the faithful were of one hart, &amp; one ſoule, and no man ſaid, the things he poſſeſſed were his owne: but after that <hi>through the inſtigation of Satan,</hi> the Greeks began to mutiny <hi>againſt the Hebrews:</hi> For the auoiding of contention there were ſome choſen to be <hi>Deacons</hi> among them: So ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordained <hi>of cuſtome,</hi> not of any diuine inſtitution; the which how wekely it followeth, hee is but a weke man that cannot well iudge. For albeit the Apoſtles alledge ſom other ſecundary cauſes, yet (it is moſt certaine) the creation of Deacons did chieffy begin of that: And therefore I ſay in like manner, that albeit I ſhould confeſſe, that the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of creating one <hi>Biſhop,</hi> ouer &amp; aboue the reſt of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was by <hi>reaſon of ſciſme,</hi> notwithſtanding it therfore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that it was done for that cauſe onely, or that it was not done of any diuine inſtitution. But the occaſion of creation of Biſhops alledged by <hi>Hierom,</hi> is a coniecture but too vncertain, &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon no likelihood of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that for the offence of one Church, the Apoſtles (contrary to the <hi>Lord his inſtitution</hi>) ſhould place one Biſhop ouer al the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which had not offended, &amp; that throughout the whole world: This were very hard. Neyther doe wee read at any time, that the Elders of the Church of Corinth, gaue the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this ſciſme, but that it was taken of the people by reaſon of that opinion they had of their Paſtors and Elders, by whome they were eyther baptized, or brought to the faith. But for men to ſwell in the vanity of theyr humors, with an ouer-priſed conceyt of theyr Teachers, as alſo of theyr parents, and place of theyr na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uity and ſuch like ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, it is (as you know) an ordinary thing among men.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8306:55"/> And yet they, for whoſe ſake this ſciſme was ſet abroache at Corinth, were not at Corinth, ſo that, for the auoyding of this ſciſme, the <hi>Elders</hi> which were to be ſet in ſom better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnder one Biſhop, were <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, &amp; <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> and ſuch diſordered fellowes, by whome the people were drawen to ſuch a ſingularity.</p>
               <p>Without doubt, me thinks this was a vayne motion, and an idle conceite of <hi>Hierome,</hi> as is alſo that which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of a <hi>decree</hi> made throughout the whole world. Good now, let me aske him this queſtion: When, or of whom that <hi>decree</hi> could be made? or at leaſt wiſe how, or by what poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means ſo generall a conſent could be obtained, agaynſt the will of the Lorde in the firſt ordinaunce of Elders. For preſently in all the Churches throughout the whole worlde, Biſhops were aboue Elders, both in honour and authority: That bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> would change the Lord his own inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; or if he would, that he could, it is not likely. The other Apoſtles, diſperſed throughout diuers regions, were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe thinges which were done at Corinth, ſo that they cannot be ſuſpected to haue giuen theyr voyces to the ratifying of this decree. But that we may imagin, that this ſciſme at Corinth came to theyr knowledge at the length; &amp; that, after ſome miraculous manner they all met together from diuerſe foreine and the fartheſt partes in the worlde (I ſay) to imagin all this; yet can any man euer imagine, that for the auoyding of this one ſciſme, they all would conſpire together for the ouerthrow of the Lord his owne inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And much leſſe could this be done after the Apoſtles time, that all Churches ſhould aſſemble and conſent, to alter and exautorate that which was both ordayned of the Lord, and deliuered of the Apoſtles: At the leaſt ſome of them would haue ſtill receyued the <hi>firſt inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of the <hi>antiquity</hi> of this cuſtome, we will call <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelfe for a witnes: and we ſhall finde him, not onely in this place, but alſo in his Epiſtle to <hi>Euagrius. At Alexandria</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>euen to Heraclas &amp; Dioniſius, Biſhops, the Elders choſe one from among themſelues, and placed him in a higher degree, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8306:55"/> named him their Biſhop: In like manner, as if an armie ſhould name them an Emperour.</hi> And yet by the way, I would not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould here be deceaued, &amp; thinke by theſe words of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> that the Elders alwaies placed one of their <hi>owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> ouer them. There are innumerable examples, where the Elders being diſcarded, the people and the cleargie, haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected either Deacons, or ſome others, which were not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the cleargie. By the which alſo it may appeare, that the churches were not acquainted at all with that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall decree, or that they had any ſuch regard therof in their elections of Biſhops, that they muſt alwaies chooſe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Elders, their ordinarie Biſhop. Yet be it ſo: and let vs yeeld thus much to <hi>Hierome,</hi> that there was ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made: then muſt wee needes ſay, that either they made the ſame, contrary vnto the Lord his inſtitution, and ſo wee muſt alſo ſay, that al thoſe fathers, &amp; al their councels ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully erred, (which wee cannot ſaye they did in anye other thing, and we haue ſhewed they could not do in this) or els we muſt ſay, that they made it in a thing indifferent, neither with the inſtitution of God, nor againſt it, but in the meere power and ſole diſpoſing of them, from whome it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: And then what are we, (ſillie men) that we ſhould once dare to condemne that decree, vnto the which all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did condeſcend? Wherefore, (as before) I now againe inferre, that this cenſure was but the priuate conceit of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> repugnaunt to the generall iudgement of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which either went before him, or liued after him. And therefore, when as he knew full wel, that it would be obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt him, that this was but his bare cenſure, not the ſentence of the holy Scripture, he aſſaieth to make good the ſame with ſcripture, and therupon he firſt pawneth <hi>Paul</hi> his Epiſtle to the Philippians, in the which hee greeteth the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops &amp; Deacons of that church: as alſo the 20. of the Acts, and the 1. of Titus, where they which were Elders, are called Biſhops. To the which places, before I make any further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it ſhal not be amiſſe to heare what <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith of this matter: he expounding this place of <hi>Paul,</hi> writeth thus: <hi>they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8306:56"/> call Biſhops,</hi> Elders, <hi>for that at that time, they had hoth the names, as it well appeareth in the</hi> 20. <hi>of the Acts, and the</hi> 1. <hi>to</hi> Titus. <hi>For with Biſhops he ioyneth Deacons, when he had made no mention of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: neither could it otherwiſe be, that there ſhould he many Biſhops the Paſtors of one citty: by which means it commeth to paſſe, that they were the Elders of one cittie, whom he calleth Biſhops.</hi> But in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle hee calleth the bleſſed <hi>Epaphrodite</hi> then <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> for hee ſaith, <hi>your Apoſtle and my companion in labour. So that he manifeſtly ſheweth, that he had the diſpenſation of a Biſhop committed to him, when he had the denomination of an Apoſtle.</hi> Thus much <hi>Theodoret</hi> Now you ſhal vnderſtand, that the error of <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> grew of the not different and confuſed vſe of theſe titles, (a Biſhop and an Elder) as they were then in vſe. But when as the ſame thing befalleth the title of an Apoſtle alſo: is it not ſtrange, that they ſhould rather erre in the one, then the other? For where as Barnabas, Epaphroditus, and manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are called Apoſtles; yet no man thereby euer thought, that there was no difference betweene them and the twelue Apoſtles: but becauſe the hiſtory of the calling of the twelue Apoſtles, (and thoſe other, which were likewiſe called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,) is better knowen vnto them, and more familiar with them, then is that of the Elders and Biſhops, (ſo commonlie called:) therefore this whole matter ſeemeth inuolued in more darke and thicke miſtes of obſcuritie, vnto ſuch as are not expert in ſearching out hidden and vnknowen hiſtories in the acts and monuments of the Apoſtles? For by reaſon of the interchangeable communitie of names, they think not that there is any difference, (or conceiue not what it is) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe diſtinct perſons, which are called by names not diſtinct. As for exemple, this name <hi>(Apoſtle)</hi> would haue deceiued him fowly, that ſhould haue gone about to haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualed all of this name with the twelue Apoſtles; &amp; ſo ſtands the caſe alſo with the name of Biſhops, for that it is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to deceiue (if it doe not daungerouſlly deceiue) thoſe, which indiſtinctly apply that one name, to the two degrees of Elders. Wherfore they muſt know, that the ſame name is not alwaies of the ſame nature, and many times one word is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8306:56"/> ſignificant as well for the general, as the particuler. And this muſt we conceiue of this word <hi>Elder,</hi> that in the capacity of his ſignification are indifferently intertained all degrees of Paſtors, ſo that the Apoſtles themſelues may generally be cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led Elders, when as properly the loweſt degree of Paſtors is beſt knowen, and moſt fitly called by that name. Beſides all this, there is in many wordes an Etimology, or proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, according to the which alſo it ſo falleth out, that many times, diuerſe names haue the ſame vſe: by which meanes, not onely Elders, but Apoſtles alſo may be deriued into the ſame name of Biſhops. This may very eaſily bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in ciuill things and names, where we may wel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the like vſe of no leſſe titles, (as <hi>Dukes, Earles, Knights, Lordes</hi> and <hi>Barons:</hi>) all which titles are giuen to many, which differ much in honour and dignitie: neither is it any new or inſolent thing, for one mightie King to haue many meaner Kinges vnder him of his name, but not of his power. The like wee may ſay of Dukes, who haue alſo vnder them other Dukes, of whome they receiue due fealtie and homage: and ſome Earls alſo, (as the <hi>Count Palatine,</hi> of <hi>Rhene,</hi> &amp; <hi>Flanders</hi>) are Lords alſo ouer other Earles. What ſhould I ſpeake of Knights, Lords, &amp; Barons, which vnder the ſame titles, haue not the ſame tipe of honor or autority. He would be laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſcorne of very children for his labour, that ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre an equality of their callings, from the qualitie of that they are called. I, but (will ſome ſay,) there is not that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Eccleſiaſticke miniſterie, and the ciuill policy. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo tell them, that I doe not compare office with office, but name with name: that all the world may ſee, how childiſh a reaſon it is, for the community of names and titles, to take away the diuerſity of things &amp; perſons. Albeit there be ſome new writers of this age, who hold opinion, that the preſiden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy of on ouer many elders, is to be aboliſhed, as a thing that hath preuailed in the church of cuſtom, &amp; vpon the curteſie of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, &amp; that againſt the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded verity of gods ſacred conſtitution; yet for al that, the vniuerſal conſent of alchur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the world, conſorting with gods word, ſhal further
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8306:57"/> with me, then the opinion male-content of the heretik <hi>Aerius,</hi> or the miſconceited iudgement of <hi>Hierome</hi> alone, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing loſt himſelfe in the ambiguity of doutful words, &amp; not fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out the antiquity of the firſt age of the church. For this is manifeſt out of the word of God, that in the time of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle, thoſe 7. Cathedral Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had their ſeuen Biſhops, and they impoſed ouer them by a certaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, not any humaine ordinaunce. For when as the holie Ghoſt there conceileth nothing, in the which, either the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelues, or they which were vnder there gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had offended: he would neuer haue paſſed ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſt reprehenſion ſo inſolent and ambitious an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, (for ſo it ſeemeth vnto ſome) as then but newly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned, and boldly brought forth into the church of God, and that confronting the flat ordinaunce of God himſelfe. No doubt, thoſe ſo famous and renowmed Churches had many Elders, and happely a colledge of Elders: and yet the defaults of thoſe churches, were not laid vppon the many Elders, but hee calleth vpon the ſeuerall and principall El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of euery particular church: whoſe autority in the church gouernment, vnleſſe it had bene ſomewhat more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, they alone ſhould neuer haue borne the blame of that function not well performed.</p>
               <p>A certaine writer of this age goeth about to defend, or at leaſt to excuſe this hereſie, (or error if you had ſo rather) of <hi>Aerius:</hi> but his reaſons with the which hee would doe it are ſo ſlanderous, ſcandalous, and reprochfull againſt the councels, and againſt the fathers, as of truth I am altogether aſhamed of them. <hi>Aerius,</hi> like a good honeſt fellowe, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, &amp; the fathers (poore ſoules) or openly accuſed of no ſmall faults, ambition and tyranny: who ſeeing he bringeth nothing woorth any thing, beſides that we haue before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of <hi>Hierome,</hi> I will not vouchſafe his cauils the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing. How much more chriſtian-like, &amp; modeſtly hath that moſt famous man, and thriſe reuerend father <hi>Zanchius,</hi> (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſufficiently renowmed for his rare learning and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) how much more like a good chriſtian, hath he written
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8306:57"/> in his <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> what hee thought concerning the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie? Theſe are his wordes: <hi>My faith is grounded chiefly and ſimply vpon the word of God, and then ſomewhat alſo vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of the whole Catholike Church; if ſo bee it repugne not the ſacred writ. For I doe beleeue, that what things were concluded and receiued of the holie Fathers, aſſembled in the name of the Lord, by a common conſent of all, without anie contradiction to the holie ſcriptures, that thoſe things alſo (althogh not of like authoritie with the ſcripture) are of the holy Ghost. Hence it commeth, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer things are of this ſort, I nor will, nor dare with a ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence diſallow them. But what one thing is more certaine, out of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, out of Councels, out of the writings of all the Fathers, then that thoſe orders of Ministers (of the which we haue ſpoken) were recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and establiſhed in the Church by the common conſent of the whole Christian common-wealth? And who am I, that what the whole Church hath allowed, I alone ſhould diſallowe? Neither yet haue all the learned men of our time dared to diſallow them, for that indeed they knew, that both theſe things were lawfull in the Church, alſo that they all were ordeined and performed of a godly religion, and to good ends, for the good of the elect. Beſides that, reaſon was, I ſhould haue regard of thoſe Churches alſo, the which although they haue imbraced the Goſpell, yet they retaine their Biſhops, both in deed and name. And what ſhall wee ſay of the Churches of the Protestants alſo, where they want not their Bishops and Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in deed, whom (hauing cast their good Greeke names, into bad Latine) they call Superintendentes, and generall Superintendentes? But where alſo, nor thoſe good old Greeke, nor theſe bad Latin names are in vſe, there notwithstanding are commonly certaine priuate &amp; eſpecial men, in whoſe hands, in a maner, is all the authoritie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now the controuerſie is concerning names; but ſeeing we doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in deed, what doe we contend about names? In the mean while, as I haue not diſalowed the Fathers in this matter which is nowe in question; ſo alſo I cannot but loue the zeale of our brethren, who therefore were out of loue with thoſe names, becauſe they feared, leaſt with the olde names, the olde ambition alſo and tyrannie should bee called in againe, to the ruine of Churches.</hi> Thus grauely diuineth that reuerend olde <hi>Zanchius:</hi> with whom I could ioyne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8306:58"/> more teſtimonies (if it were needfull) of the beſt writers of our time, to confirme this matter: who are either who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of our opinion, or very ſparingly of the contrary. But for this time lonely <hi>Zanchius</hi> ſhal ſtand for the reſt, leaſt I ſhould ouercharge this ſmal volume with a multitude of witneſſes</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow that we haue proued that gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church to be of God, in the which Paſtors are ſubiect to Paſtors, and Elders ſuppliant to their Biſhops: we are in the ſequele of this our diſcourſe, to ſee and examine, <hi>Whether one Church or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſe is not capiable of two or more Bishops, at the ſame time, of the ſame tipe and authoritie.</hi> True it is, that the Church of Hieruſalem had the twelue A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, the ſeuentie two Diſciples, with the Prophets, their Biſhops: neither are examples wanting of diuers churches, which haue had ioyntly together diuers Biſhops. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writing againſt the Arrian hereſie, falling into ſome menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſeemeth to intimate thus much; That in that age there was this cuſtome in diuers Churches, that they might haue two Biſhops at once, when as notwithſtanding in the church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he affirmeth there was no ſuch cuſtome.</p>
               <p>To the which, I thus anſwer: Firſt, that the twelue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, &amp; the reſt, remained at Hieruſalem for a certaine time, but they were appointed Biſhops &amp; Teachers, not for that one Cittie onely, but for the whole world. Now for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of certaine Citties, which at one time had their <hi>two bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;</hi> what manner cuſtome that was, how rare &amp; extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie it was, we may ſufficiently learne by that one election of <hi>Augustine,</hi> who was made Biſhop, while <hi>Valerius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hippon</hi> yet liued. The which thing was done, as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, ſo contrary to the decree of the <hi>Nicene</hi> councel. But what rule ſo general, that ſuffereth no exception? It is no ſin
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8306:58"/> I confeſſe, for one Church to haue many Paſtors of equall power, but whether it be conuenient it ſhould bee ſo, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will teach. Indeed of old, the Biſhops being of great yeares, ſometimes would name their ſucceſſor, and aſſume a fellow-laborer in office with them, and that, partly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the tumults which commonly infeſted their elections: and partly alſo, becauſe ſometimes the Biſhops being diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by age &amp; ſicknes, were not ſufficing to diſcharge their duties in their owne perſons: for which cauſe it was lawfull for the new Elect to ſupply the aged his place, &amp; ſit together in the ſame chaire. As for <hi>Valerius</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Hippon,</hi> hee beeing moued thereunto by the example of foreine Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, got <hi>Auguſtine</hi> with much adoe to be ioyned with him: but how vnwillingly hee vndertooke that place, albeit hee were importuned therunto, as well by the praiers, as by the preſidents of others, he expreſſely teſtifieth in his 110. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; Wherein are reported what things were done at the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignement of <hi>Eradius</hi> Prieſt, to ſucceede <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprike, as they were taken by the notarie, the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and confirming the ſame: to whom hee thus ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>I know that you know</hi> (ſaith he) Eradius <hi>to be a fit man, and worthy of a bishoprike, but I would not there should bee that done by him, that was done to me: but what was done your ſelues can many of you witnes: they onely cannot tel, which either were not as then born, or as yet had not the capacitie to know. While as yet my Father and bishop,</hi> Valerius <hi>of famous memory liued in the flesh, I was ordeined then bishop, and I ſate together with him, the which thing I then knew not that it was inhibited by the Councel of</hi> Nice, <hi>neither did he know.

                  <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> in an epiſtle to <hi>Gregorie Nyſſen,</hi> writeth of this cuſtome in theſe wordes: <hi>But if anie man contend, that whilest one Biſhop is liuing, an other ought to bee elected, let him knowe that theſe thinges are of no force against vs. For it is manifest and apparant vnto all the worlde, that wee are preſident, not onelie at</hi> Naziantz, <hi>but alſo at</hi> Soſrie, <hi>and that (ſetting apart the reuerence of our auncient Fathers and graue Doctors,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8306:59"/> and thoſe that laboured the ſame of vs with their vrgent prayers) we tooke vpon vs that preſidencie as ſtraungers.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzene.</hi> By the which we may vnderſtand, how inſolent and extraordinarie a thing it was, that one Church ſhould haue two Biſhops. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> alſo made ſome ſmall mention of this cuſtome, that he might ſhew the cauſe, why <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did not immediately ſucceed <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſeeing hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted thereunto by <hi>Alexander;</hi> namely, for that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> did not permit, that hee ſhould be choſen Biſhop, while their Biſhop yet liued. Moſt true it is indeed, that both the Biſhops and the people were perſwaded of this, That one Church did admit but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: when it was otherwiſe, Neceſsitie which hath no lawe did excuſe it. When <hi>Constantius,</hi> at the requeſt of certaine noble Matrons, had called Biſhop <hi>Liberius</hi> from exile, and would haue had him to gouerne the Church of Rome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Foelix,</hi> who was then ſurrogate and ſubſtitute in his place: the people hearing the Emperours letters, and ſcorning the contents, thundred together with one voice; <hi>One God, one Christ, and one Biſhop. Cyprian</hi> alſo writing of the lawfull election of <hi>Cornelius: Seeing that after the first</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there cannot bee a ſecond; whoſoeuer is made after one (who ought to be one and alone) he is now no more ſecond, but none at all.</hi> like manner <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who was in the age before <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and is accounted the ſecond, or third Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> after the Apoſtles; reducing the gifts of the onely one God, to an vnitie in the Church, writeth thus; <hi>There is</hi> one <hi>fleſh of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> one <hi>bloud that was ſhed for vs, alſo</hi> one <hi>bread which is broken to vs all, and</hi> one <hi>cuppe which is giuen to vs all, there is</hi> one <hi>Altar for the whole Church, and there is</hi> one <hi>bishop with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Elders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fathers reaſon was this: becauſe God would (whoſe will is a law to vs) that there ſhould bee but <hi>one high Peiest</hi> in the old Teſtament: with whome (ſo long as he liued) no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might bee ſurcharged: vnleſſe haplie hee had defiled himſelfe with anie notorious crime, or by chaunce had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into ſome vncleane diſeaſe, which might make him ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8306:59"/> vnapt, or vnable to perform his ſacred dutie. The which although it contained in it a ſecrete myſterie, of the which the Church at this day retaineth no preſent memorie: yet the policie of this myſterie (which by no meanes is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorſed from it) ought not to be controlled of any that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſtianitie.</p>
               <p>If anie man heere ſuppoſe, that by this reaſon the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Biſhop of Rome may bee maintained: to him I ſay, that he taketh the matter amiſſe: For there is great ods betweene a paſtoral prefecture ouer one region, and an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall prerogatiue ouer the whole world. So ample and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtious is that his ſupreme empire and ſuperlatiue degree in the Church, as that it dilateth it ſelfe ouer all Chriſtian churches whereſoeuer, throughout the whole world; but was the whole world at anie time demiſed to anie one Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle? <hi>Peter</hi> had the ſea Apoſtolike ouer the circumciſion, and <hi>Paule</hi> ouer the vncircumciſed: but yet ſo, as they excluded not their compeers and copartners in the ſame power with them. For <hi>Iames</hi> alſo was the Apoſtle of the Iewes, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Hieruſalem, and in all Iudea: but <hi>Peter</hi> ouer thoſe which were diſperſed among the Gentiles onely. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Paule</hi> limited his ſea Apoſtolike among the Greeks of Aſia and Europe, leauing in the meane while other prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for other Apoſtles. If in like manner the Biſhop of Rome had contented and conteined himſelf within the precincts of his owne territorie, how ſhould any man haue accuſed him of any impious or vſurped tyrannie?</p>
               <p>Againe, for as much as it appeareth, that the Apoſtolike traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſo much as concerneth the regiment of the church and the outward policie thereof) was taken of our Sauiour, and afterwards alſo of the Apoſtles, from out of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; (ſo far forth as the condition of time and place, &amp; the ſtate of the people and perſons might permit) can there bee any errour in this, if the Fathers (their ſucceſſors) ſeeme in like manner to borrowe from the ſame foundation, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine politike conſtitutions, for the edifiyng of the Church? Vpon this occaſion <hi>Hierome</hi> thus writeth to <hi>Euagrius: And
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8306:60"/> in that we knowe, that the Apostolike traditions were taken out of the old Testament: that which</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſons, and the Leuites were in the Temple, the ſame are the Biſhops, Elders, and Deacons, in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that ouer euery ſeuerall prouince or precinct (which make as it were one Cittie) they verie well and worthily placed ſeuerall Biſhops; and likewiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer euery whole cuntry or regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either Patriarchs, or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, or Primates, or Metrapolitanes (call them as you pleaſe) &amp; moreouer that this was done of the antique Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels &amp; Fathers, to ſingular purpoſe, &amp; well conſorting with Gods holy ordinance. With the which that I may at the laſt determine this controuerſie: of thoſe things which I haue already declared and concluded, as well of the offices of the Goſpell (which were ordeined of the Lord, and left vnto the Church by his Apoſtles) as alſo of the vniforme conſent of the Councels, and continuall practiſe of the Church in all ages, it ſhalbe eaſie for all men to know, That that gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not of man, or from man, in the which the Elders ar ſubiect to their elder Biſhops, &amp; the Biſhops to their high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er Patriarchs, &amp; Metropolitanes; but contrarywiſe, that the ſame is diuine, and ordeined of God, and that as well in the old, as the new Teſtament.</p>

To the which, before I goe any further, I make them this anſwere: That thoſe offices are there compriſed and contained in the names of <hi>Apostles</hi> &amp; <hi>Euangelists;</hi> and in the 12. to the Rom. verſe 8. in the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>Ruler,</hi> (or <hi>he that ruleth;</hi>) and in the firſt to the Corinthians the 12. chap. and 28. verſe, in the worde (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>gouernors:</hi> by all which tearmes and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, the ſacred order of ſuperior Paſtors are vnderſtoode. But that the aforeſaid offices of Apoſtles &amp; Euangeliſts are perpetuall, wee haue already proued, and it may alſo ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appeare by the ſequele of that enumeration of thoſe offices; namely, when he ſetteth down to what end our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour gaue to the Church, ſome <hi>Apostles,</hi> and other <hi>Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.</hi> Was it not <hi>for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edification of the body of Christ?</hi> So that, ſo long as the Church is to be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſo long thoſe offices are to be continued in the Church which are there conteined. If the Church could haue beene edified without them, they ſhould neuer haue ben ordeined in the Church. But againe, that part of them are thought to be temporal, &amp; part particular; that thought is ouerthrown by the onely end of that for the which they were ordeined; which end is to be ſought for continually of all the faithful euen vntill the comming of the Lord. For are they not ſtill to edifie by theſe offices, &amp; to grow together into one myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body of Chriſt? Now albeit the office of biſhops &amp; arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, primates, &amp; patriarchs, doth not extend it ſelfe ſo far as did the office of the twelue Apoſtles: (neither are they inriched with the like treaſure or meaſure of the holy Ghoſt) yet are wee to conſider that this difference is in the qualitie not in the quidditie of the ſame function: in the meaſure, not in the matter of their commiſſion. And therfore, whom at this day we call Biſhops &amp; Archbiſhops, <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle called Apoſtles; for that (as we haue ſaid) they are ioyned in the ſame combinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; made partakers of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsion.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8306:61"/> And for this cauſe the calling of Archbiſhops &amp; Patriarchs, hath beene alwaies called, and is yet to be accounted <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike</hi> in all places.</p>
               <p>Yet, for as much as theſe names and titles, doe ſeeme in ſome mens eyes, to be puffed vp with the tumors of pride and ambition, let vs take a further view of thoſe principall obiects, and friuolous obiections, by the which they are caſt into this no leſſe ſtraunge then ſtrong conception. Their firſt argument is forced from the compoſition of the Greek words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which (as they take it) ſignifieth that principalitie and power, which is proper to the ciuill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate only, impertinent to that modeſtie and ſimplicitie, which the doctrine of the Goſpel requireth of a Paſtor. To the which, they alſo adde the ſentence of the Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which forbad anie Biſhoppe to bee called Prince of the Prieſts; The wordes of the Canon are theſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The which <hi>Gratian</hi> in his ninetie nine diſtinction tranſlateth thus: <hi>The Biſhop of the chiefe place shall not be called prince of the Prieſtes, or high Priest, or any other ſuch thing, but onely, Biſhop of the chiefe place.</hi> Beſides all this (ſay they) the word <hi>Archbishop</hi> differeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>(Prince of Paſtors:)</hi> the which name or title, ſeeing it is only proper to Chriſt alone we cannot ſee, how he ſhould bee excuſed of heinous ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, that doth any way vſurpe the ſame. And therefore all ſuch names are to be caſt ouer bord, and vtterly to be exiled the Church of Chriſt. Neither is the arguing of theſe names to be taken for trifling, when as they ſeem ſo greatly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the name of Chriſt. And laſt of all thoſe names which Antichriſt himſelfe, or the ſpirit of Antichriſt, hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inuented, or inueſted into the Church, are to bee auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but that Antichriſt was the forger of theſe titles, it is a plaine caſe, and therefore to be auoided.</p>
               <p>To that, I anſwer: That the ſence &amp; true meaning of theſe names &amp; titles by way of compoſition, with the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, conteineth nothing in it, eyther arrogant for ambition, or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8306:61"/> for cuſtome inſolent. For I will teach them, (if they bee to learne) that the greeke worde <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth not onely ſignifie <hi>Principality</hi> and <hi>Magistracie,</hi> but alſo the firſt, the beginning and original cauſe of any thing: and beſides this, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it foloweth the nature of that word, with the which it is compounded: and ſo, ſeeing the name of a Biſhop doth ſignifie of it ſelfe, and in his owne nature nothing that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent or ambitious, take the name <hi>Archbiſhoppe</hi> which way you wil, it cannot any waies ſound of any vaine or vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſenſe: as it plainely appeareth in other wordes of like compoſition, as <hi>Architectos, Archiatros, Architriclinus, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibubulcus,</hi> which ſignifie a Maiſter-worke-man, a Arch-phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, a Gentleman-vſher, a chiefe Herdſ-man, and ſuch like. By all which we may manifeſtly ſee, that the name of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> being in nature good, the name of <hi>Archbishop</hi> cannot be in compoſition euill: ſeeing that thereby it ſignifieth rather the firſt and chiefe Biſhop, then the Lord and Prince of Biſhops. Albeit I would not, (nor need I) greatly ſticke with him for the name of <hi>Prince</hi> neither, were it in vſe with vs, as in ſenſe it is with the Latines, onely for a chiefe and principall man. But now ſeeing that name is aduanced to a more roiall and imperiall ſenſe, from hence-forth, I will either not vſe it, or vſe it verie thriftely.</p>
               <p>The like may wee ſay of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that among good Grecians, it doth not alwaies ſignifie a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or a man in authority, but many times alſo it ſtandeth for the firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or originall cauſe of any thing. So that <hi>Patriarche,</hi> doth no more ſignifie him which gouerneth in the Magiſtracy, or exerciſeth authoritie ouer others, then doth <hi>Hereſiarch,</hi> who is ſo called, for that hee is the firſt brother and brocher of that hereſie, not that hee exerciſeth anye dominion ouer the rank kamiel of that poyſonous rable. In very deed, a <hi>Patriark</hi> ſignifieth the <hi>first parent</hi> of any people or ofſpring: in which ſence alſo the ſame word is deriued to our vſe, to ſignifie an <hi>Archbiſhop;</hi> becauſe that he among the other Biſhops (which are counted Fathers) is as it were the <hi>Graundfather:</hi> and that thereby alſo wee might further conceiue, that the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8306:62"/> he hath ouer others, is meere father-like, not tyrannik So that for modeſty ſake wer they called, rather Archbiſhops and Patriarkes, then <gap reason="foreign">

And thus at the laſt it may appear at the ful, that here is no name giuen to the Biſhop of the chief place, which was forbidden by the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Canon: ſeeing that a Patriarke &amp; Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop in their proper ſenſe, doe ſignifie no other then the <hi>chief Biſhop:</hi> who if he be called <hi>Prince</hi> of the Biſhops, among them which write more pure Latine, no man ought to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeued therfore: for that (as I haue alredy noted) the word <hi>Prince</hi> among them, is no more but as <hi>principall</hi> and <hi>chiefe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs. And this is that which <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath written vpon the fourth of the <hi>Epheſians.

               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing that by this name, is onely ſignified the chiefe and principall Paſtour of ſome one Prouince, it doth no more derogat from the glory of Chriſt, then when wee call other Elders and Biſhops by the name of Paſtors and Doctors: ſeeing that properly Chriſt alone is our Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Teacher, and indeede that onelye good <hi>Shepheard,</hi> which gaue his life for vs.</p>

And therefore, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hee be, that knoweth as well as I can tell him, that theſe names and titles are in ſenſe manifolde, and ambiguous in ſignification, ſo that they may be giuen to diuerſe things in diuerſe reſpectes, and yet holdeth plea in this ſort, hee doth but ſeeme to holde himſelfe play in a ſerious matter, to make an idle ſhewe of his vaine wit, and a ſinfull ſpoyle of the ſimple reader. For my part, hauing reſolued vppon that which before wee haue taught: namely, <hi>That in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the Church, Biſhoppes were placed ouer Biſhoppes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto God his diuine ordinance and inſtitution;</hi> I cannot ſee howe that methode of Gods diſtinct order, coulde haue beene expreſſed in more apt and fit termes (after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles deceaſe) then by theſe reuerend titles of <hi>Patriarks</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhops.</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8306:63"/> there is not ſo much ſtate or pride, as ſome preſume.</p>
               <p>I but (will ſome ſay,) our Biſhops and Archbiſhops doe entertaine ſecular charges, and inuade ciuill honours, and are imboſt with temporall titles: all the which, how croſly they confront the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and the good meaning of their titles, who ſo blinde as may not ſee it? To this I would anſwere, before I proceed any further: but it is not for this place, neither dooth this queſtion fall into this treatiſe. Wherefore, hereafter I will ſet down what I thinke of this matter, when I come to his proper place.</p>
               <p>In the meane while (gentle Reader) ſuppoſe, I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not thoſe which now liue, (who whiles they ar in view, are enuied) but thoſe faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt Ieſus, who heereto-fore haue ruled the church with great fruit, before the tyranny of Rome abuſed the Church of God: namely, <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Gregorie Nyſen, Baſil</hi> the great, <hi>Athanaſius, Chriſostome, Cyprian, Ignatius, Polycarpus, Ambroſe, Auguſtine,</hi> and ſuch like: whoſe liues as they are further from our eies, ſo from our enuye. Theſe cannot I with any good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doe not you of any conceit condemne of pride, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tyranny, or Anticriſtianiſme, for whome all the world will ſtand vp &amp; witnes, that they were Biſhops, Archbiſhops and Patriarches, and gouerned the churches after a ſinguler maner, and with an eſpeciall power ouer the reſt. If any man thinke hee haue a ſingle gift in theſe thinges, and ſuppoſe he haue the ſpirit of diſcretion, as his familiar (to diſcerne ſpirits) good leaue hath hee, let him vſe it: but let him take heed, his ſpirit of diſcretion proue not the ſpirit of preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I verely can finde no ſuch ſpirite of Antichriſt in thoſe moſt chriſtian fathers: I find they were men, and had their errors: and yet in this argument, their writings are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority with me, then are they which haue written of the ſame matter in this age, and within our memorie.</p>
               <p>But nowe concerning the laſt exception againſt their names (I meane of Arch biſhops.) I anſwere, and deny that they were the inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions of Antichriſt; this firſt, &amp; then alſo, that whatſoeuer was inuented, (or is vſurped either) of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8306:63"/> is hand ouer head to be reiected of vs; for of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (a neceſſary pollicy) he deuiſed, rather then inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, ſome good things, that with them he might ouercaſt many bad. So doth Satan many times tranſforme himſelfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light, that he may deceyue without ſuſpect; hee fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth holines; that he may draw into wickednes: hee defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the truth, that he may driue into error. (For he ſhould bewray himſelf too groſſely, if he ſhould teach nothing but leaſings.) But yet, can there bee a more witleſſe concluſion then this, Antichriſt taught this, <hi>ergo</hi> it is falſe? Antichriſt deuiſed this, <hi>ergo</hi> it is naught? vnleſſe it ſhould be interſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or at leaſt vnderſtood, that the ſame is contrary alſo to the worde of God. As for example, that which <hi>Peter</hi> was taught of the holy Ghoſt, hee confeſſed with a liuely faith, namely, That Ieſus was the very Chriſt, and the onely ſonne of the liuing God. But now, doth not <hi>Antichrist</hi> alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame with his mouth? yea whoſoeuer dare deny the ſame, he condemneth to the fagot. Doth he not alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſacred volumes of Gods holy word? yes and more then that foraſmuch as the Lord hath taught vs in his word, that we ſhould pray continually, he hath of himſelfe deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to deuide the whole day in matinges and euen ſong. But now (to come to the poynt) becauſe hee abuſeth vnto ſuperſtition both faſting and prayer, and the holy Bible, and the bleſſed confeſſion of the ſonne of God, ſhall we therfore (all in a fling) renounce theſe thinges? Admit it be his deſire that the miniſtery ſhould be of ſom reckoning in the world, and that it ſhould be aduanced to no meane degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the common wealth: And what then? that we may not be like vnto him, ſhal we requite the Miniſters of Chriſt with ſhame for fame, and with ſlaunders for honours? And becauſe he ſeeketh to magnify them without meane, ſhall we ſuffer them to lie ſubiect and abiect among the baſeſt routs of the common meany? If braine-ſicke men vppon a quarelous minde may preſently gaineſay whatſoeuer the Biſhop of Rome hath ſayd, or don: I fear me in the end, they wil in their great haſt ouerrun all chriſtian religion, &amp; leaue
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8306:64"/> it far behinde them. Wherfore, whoſoeuer ſhall think euery thing forthwith to be reiected, for that eyther the author thereof abuſed the ſame to tyranny, or the Biſhop of Rome inuerted the ſame to ſuperſtition, he is eaſely to be carried with euery ſhallow ſtreame into any deepe error.</p>
               <p>What things ſoeuer are in the Church of Rome (that now is) may iuſtly be diſtinguiſhed into three parts: Wherof ther are ſome things that wel conſort with the word of God; and ſome, that do flatly contradict the ſame; but the moſt things are ſuch, as there vſe is; eyther good, or bad: which thinges are called, things <hi>indifferent.</hi> Now, albeit bad men may make a bad vſe of good thinges, yet can they not inuert the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therof. Baptiſme, the word of God, or whatſoeuer elſe (of that kinde) the Romaniſts haue in vſe, no wiſe man will therefore reiect, as if they were euil, becauſe they haue not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel. As for things vtterly euil, becauſe no man at any time vſeth them well, they are vtterly to be reiected of vs, as is all kind of Idolatry, &amp; whatſoeuer doth either vndermine, or ouerthrow the ſound &amp; ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall doctrine of truth. But as for things <hi>indifferent,</hi> ſeeing they are ſuch as is he that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them; they are left in our power to vſe them, as time &amp; occaſion ſhal require. An <hi>indifferent</hi> thing is commonly that, whatſoeuer is nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, nor commended in the word of God, &amp; is left free to euery mans choiſe, either to vſe, or not vſe: vnles ſome other thing interchaunce, which altereth the vſe of that which otherwiſe was free, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the time or place, or the perſon, wher the ſame is in vſe. For my part, I think things mediat &amp; indifferent might better be defined thus: if we ſhall ſay, thoſe thinges are <hi>indifferent,</hi> which by no law, either Gods law or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s law, are bidden, or forbidden. For by the command of him which hath the authority ouer our perſons, the vſe of a thing, which otherwiſe is free, may many waies, &amp; vppon many occaſions be reſtrained, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled: But of theſe things, in this place, we are not now to diſcourſe at large. Onely thus much I chiefly note, &amp; would haue iuſt notice taken of it, that <hi>indifferent</hi> thinges may bee vſed of vs, although the ſame things haue ben abuſed by the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8306:64"/> biſhop of Rome, or any other Antichriſt. Is our liberty to be preiudiced by an other mans religion? ſpecially, where pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique authority hath any thing to do in the matter? ſuppoſe it either giueth vs in charge, or putteth vs in choiſe, to vſe thoſe things which the ſuperſtitious haue abuſed: Wherfore whenſoeuer anything ſhal come in queſtion among vs, that hath bene vſed among the Romaniſts, or other enemies of the truth, it is our part to examine and conſider the matter, as it is in ſelfe, not as it was with them.</p>
               <p>There are ſome in England at this day, who take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more ſowrely, then ſeuerely, againſt outward veſtementes, cap &amp; ſurples, muſicke and organs, and ſuch like rites of the Church: the which, becauſe they were of ſome vſe in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, now out vppon them, they are ſacriligious &amp; prophane. In like maner, and with no leſſe modeſty, do they proceede againſt Biſhops &amp; Archbiſhops, their honors and reuenews; Al the which, vnles they could be proued contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the word of God, what reaſon is this they bring (and it is al they bring) for the aboliſhing thereof: when they ſay, the author or inuentor therof was Antichriſt? No doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things which he abuſed for his tyranny, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to a better vſe, for the good of the Church.</p>
               <p>Now, as for conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tious natures &amp; ſuch, in whoſe breſts this error hath taken faſt footing, namely, <hi>That the authority of Biſhops is a thing pernitious in itſelf, and preiudicial to the church;</hi> I know this my aunſwere, as it fitteh not their humors, ſo it ſerueth not their turns. Neither yet will they vouchſafe of that, which I haue ſaid of the natural ſignification of words compound with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Wherfore, albeit the plaineſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the names of Patriarchs and Archbiſhops like me beſt, yet notwithſtanding I dare ſay thus much further, if we ſhould gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (that which they ſhal neuer euince) that by force of compoſition a kind of principallity were to be inferred: yet doth it not theruppon follow, that it is therefore a title abhorring from the ſtate of our BB. For let it be lawfull for men to vrge the ſignification of euery ſillable in this ſort, &amp; it ſhal forthwith be vnlawful for any, to be called a monarch,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8306:65"/> or to be inueſted with the title of an Emperour: for why? forſooth, theſe names in theyr proper ſenſe, are common to none, but to God onely. Theſe and ſuch like titles of lawful and neceſſary vſe among vs, muſt vppon this quirk be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aboliſhed: neyther may it be lawfull for vs from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to call our Miniſters (as the Scripture doth) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> (<hi>Rectors</hi> or <hi>Rulers, Prelates</hi> or <hi>Preſidentes:</hi>) nay we ſhall not be able to auouch the name of <hi>Elders,</hi> becauſe this, and theſe all in ſacred Scripture, are proper to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Princes, and the Nobles of ſundry prouinces, and and yet for all this we ſee, that Miniſters of the Church are called by theſe names.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, if the authority of the Fathers, may be of any preuail, let vs hear what great dainty they make of the name of <hi>Prince,</hi> in the titles of the cleargy. <hi>Origen</hi> reprehending the clowniſhe ſourenes of ſome Biſhops, writeth thus; <hi>A man may ſee in ſome Churches, (eſpecially in the greatest Citties) how the</hi> Princes <hi>of the chriſtian people, ſhew no manner affability to any: eſteeming thereof as a thing nothing at all pertaining vnto them, &amp;c.</hi> And aftewards againe: <hi>We ſpeake not theſe thinges as if we meant to diſcharge the Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Principality. In like manner vppon the Epiſtle to the Romanes the thirteenth Chapter. <hi>By the which it appeareth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Iudges of the world do performe the greateſt part of Gods law. For all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults that God would haue puniſhed, he puniſheth not by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and</hi> Princes <hi>of the Church, but by the Iudges of the worlde.</hi> And vpon the twenty ſeuen Chapter of Numbers, the two and twenty Homily. <hi>Let the</hi> Princes (ſaith hee) <hi>of Churches learne, not to appoynt their ſucceſſors after them, ſuch as are allied vnto them, eyther in affinity of kindred, or conſanguinity of bloud, neyther that they ought to make the</hi> Principality <hi>of Churches here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, &amp;c. Ignatius,</hi> no leſſe godly then grauely; <hi>My Son</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>honour God and the King: and I ſay further, honor God as the author of al things and the owner; and honor the Bishop as</hi> Prince <hi>of the Prieſts, bearing, the image of God, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his principality, &amp; the image of Chriſt, by means of his Prieſthood. He that honoreth the Bishop, ſhall be honored of God, as alſo he that dishonoreth him,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8306:65"/> shall be punished of God, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides many other things in the ſame place to the ſame ſence. The ſame man in an other place. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let all things be performed among you according to a direct order in Chriſt: Let Lay men be ſubiect to Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Deacons to Prieſts, Prieſts to Biſhops, the Bishop to Chriſt, as he is alſo to the Father.</hi> Againe to the Church of Antioch. <hi>You Elders feede the flocke which is committed vnto you, vntill God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt him, which shal</hi> reign <hi>ouer you: For I am now ſacrificed: that I may gaine Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> By which words, the holy Martyr hath ſufficiently teſtified the authority of a Biſhop ouer the reſt of the Elders.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe in auncient time, the authority of Biſhops was great in the Church, theyr reuerence great, and theyr fauour great among the people: the which of al other things made moſt for the benefit and increaſe of the Church. Euen as in the common wealth, the fauour of the Magiſtrats and authority is beneficiall to the people, ſo likewiſe of Biſhops in the Church. And therefore for good cauſe thought <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> that the welfare of the Church did depend of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the chiefe Prieſt &amp;c. Neyther in deed is this the leaſt ſlight of Satan, when he laboreth to bring the prelats of the Church into contempt, for by that meanes he thinketh to imbecil the doctrine of fayth, and to bring that into ſuſpect, that ſo at the laſt he might (if poſſible he could) bring an vtter ruine, and a ruined ouerture to the whole ſtate of the Church. To which purpoſe whoſoeuer they be, that make themſelues the Diuell his ſtipendaries, vnder what colour ſo euer they doe it, they diſcerue but badly, not onely of the whole Church, but alſo of the common wealth. <hi>That which a rebell is in the ſtate, the ſame is a ſciſmaticke in the Church.</hi>

               <p>How iuſt cauſe the aduerſe part here in England hath, to bring theyr Biſhops into the obloquy and enuy of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it ſmally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth me: I ſet not as arbiter between both parts. But this I ſay; that the ſame things which betideth the Biſhops here in England, doth vſually befall all the beſt of the Miniſtery in Holland alſo, who are in no leſſe enuy with the people there, then our Biſhops are here.

                  </gap> the deare ſeruants of Chriſt, (and that by name) their ſhameful and ſhameles libels doe teſtifie at large. Of which wrongs ſeeing I my ſelfe (whiles I conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them) bate not the leaſt ſhare, &amp; yet bear, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to any, if for my part, I like the better of Biſhops. For I am not ignorant of this, that this is but the ordinary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of al Gods ſeruantes; and that Satan of old and long ſince, hath by all poſſible and peſtilent meanes endeuored, to make the preſidents of Chriſt his Church, odious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous among men; that ſo, their credit eſpecially, being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether crackt, or very ſore craſed, himſelfe might with more facility and leſſe iealoſie ſet abroach and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, all manner hideous and helliſh Hereſies. In ſo much that I am perſwaded, if <hi>Moyſes</hi> himſelfe, if <hi>Peter,</hi> if <hi>Paul</hi> were reſident among vs, and were in that honour and eſteeme, which were fit and well-beſeeming their ſo honorable a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they could not poſſible eſcape the cankred chaps of theſe foule-mouthed Hell houndes. But ſo long as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of Chriſt are in authority in the Church, it is not much that the inſtruments of Satan can atchieue: but are they once brought vnder the hatch? alas, what is it that the ſeditious dare not atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt? This matter need no great proof, it hath too much.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, of that degree of Honor, which the Prelats of Religion ought to inioy in an eſtabliſhed chriſtian common wealth, the very vilenes of this age doth inforce me to ſpeak more at large. For if baſe men cannot abide, that Religion ſhould be in any Honor, and villanous minds endeuor their worſt, that the credit thereof may be none at all, or worſe then it is, I thinke it no great wonder: but, that religious men (as they would ſeeme) ſhould attempt the ſame, &amp; euen they, which ought to be patrones and preſeruers of the Church dignities, it is a thing odious, prepoſterous and too bad abſurd. Doe they not yell in vaine, and cry out againſt abuſes to no purpoſe, whoſe end is not ſo much to mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the abuſe of thinges, as to aboliſhe the whole vſe? If
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8306:66"/> the gouernours of the Church, haue not ſo beautified theyr Miniſtery with that integrity of manners, and innocency of life, which reaſon &amp; the reuerence of Religion doth require; I defend them not, but that according to the lawes they may be ſeuerely puniſhed, and theyr betters ſurrogat into theyr places: Neyther are they exempt from the iuriſdiction of the chiefe Magiſtrates, whereby they may not cenſure vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, theyr liues and theyr goods, as vppon other cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. No queſtion, it greatly concerneth both Prince and people, that good men be placed ouer the Church, and euil men remoued theyr places: So that, whatſoeuer crimes are here, or elſe where obiected (and proued) againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of Religion, they are ſtaynes to the chiefe Magiſtrate, which tollerateth ſuch Miniſters in the Church, or aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſuch like to be Church officers.</p>
               <p>There is not the like reaſon of the Romiſh cleargy: For they haue theyr peculiar Magiſtrates; nor liue they vnder the common law of other Cittizens, neyther yet are they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted any part of them, (any longer then may ſtand with their owne commodity.)

                  <hi>Of Doctors.</hi> Chap. XXVI.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Apoſtle in the fourth to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians nameth Paſtors and Doctors, a man cannot certainely gather from the manner of his ſpeech, whether hee would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuerſe in office, or but one and the ſame, and that, becauſe a Paſtor is neceſſarily a Doctor or teacher, but not ſo conuerſiuely. Wherefore the thing it ſelfe muſt help vs out: For not euery one, whome the Lord hath endewed with learning, and with a ſound gift of teaching, hath preſently withal receiued the authority of a Paſtor: The knowledge and ſcience of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, may be giuen to any man; Kings, Nobles, Knights, may be learned, who notwithſtanding are not fitte to be ouer any Churches. And albeit the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and gouernance of the Church are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with the office of teaching, that he cannot be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, which is not a teacher; notwithſtanding that followeth not in good conuerſion, that euery one who hath receyued the power to teach, ſhould forthwith be an Elder, or Biſhop of the Church: theſe thinges are diſtinct each from other. From among thoſe which are apt to teach, Elders and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are choſen, and of old, the Prieſthood was neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power to interpret: but yet the gift of prophecie, and the ability to interpret did not make a Prieſt. The Prieſt was of duety an interpreter of the law, and a Doctor, &amp; a Prophet, but yet euery doctor of the law, or prophet, was not a prieſt. An Apoſtle in deed, was both Prophet, and Doctor, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, but euery Prophet or Doctor, was not an Apoſtle or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. Seeing therefore that Doctors are diſtinguiſhed from Paſtors, &amp; the knowledge of the myſteries of God with the faculty to expound them, is the gift of the holy ſpirit: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer excell in that gift, and can as wel by writing as word of mouth edify the Church, they are to be reputed for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, of what eſtate ſoeuer they be: the king ſhal derogat no more from his royall Maieſty, if for the edifying of Gods
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8306:67"/> people, he compoſe any godly worke, then did <hi>Dauid</hi> or <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> of old, who in there time were no les renowmed for their heauenly wiſdome, then for their princely power. Although the Apoſtle forbid a woman to ſpeake in the congregation, yet if ſhee bee learned, ſhee may write, and priuately inſtruct her familie. Wherefore now, if we will come to the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Apoſtolike writings: wee muſt with ſound iudgement put difference, between Paſtors, &amp; Doctors, who beſides the teaching &amp; interpreture of the word, did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe intermedle with any thing in the church. For albeit in the infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of the church, thoſe firſt chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, had no publik profeſſed ſchooles: yet was it alwaies lawfull for Prophetes and Doctors to teach publicklie in the church; vnto whoſe graue aduice, the faithfull were no leſſe bound to obey, then to their Paſtors. But all this while, they had not the power of the Church cenſure, nor the right to redres whatſoeuer was amiſſe. Wee read of <hi>Stephanus, Fortunatus,</hi> and <hi>Achaicus,</hi> that they taught in the church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> but wee finde not, that they had there the authority of Biſhoppes and Elders. And therefore no woonder, though the corruptions and abuſes which raigned among them, were not giuen them in charge to correct, or that it was not layde to their charge that they did not correct; for there was no remedye, they muſt ſuffer that they could not remedy, and in the meane while, expect <hi>Paule</hi> his comming amongſt them. Likewiſe in the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> a man might well wonder, why <hi>Paule</hi> ioyned not in like commiſſion with <hi>Titus, Zenas</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> expounders of the lawe (they beeing then alſo in Creat:) except it were for this, that they were Doctors onely: for hee was not ignorant, that they were then alſo with <hi>Titus.</hi> Doubtleſſe, had they bin of the ſame order and power, they ſhould alſo haue receiued the ſame charge. And might it not better haue bene perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of three, then of one? But yet wee ſee, that the Apoſtle gaue the charge of <hi>Teaching</hi> there to many, the power of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> to one alone. By the which it appeareth, that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Prophetes of thoſe times, were an aide vnto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, &amp; that they taught vnder their direction. For indeed it chiefly concerneth the dutie of a Biſhop, to teach the church
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8306:68"/> committed to his charge, by himſelfe, and by others.</p>

                  </gap>ed of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that there are certaine hiſtories hidden in the Apoſtles writings: the ignorance whereof, many times hath bene the cauſe of much error in the church. But thus it came to paſſe, that the Biſhops gaue lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to teach the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnto thoſe, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> call Lay-men: The which thing, <hi>Euſebius</hi> recordeth in his ſixt booke, the 13. chapter, concerning <hi>Origen.</hi> That when as yet he was not prieſted, hee did notwithſtanding ſet vp ſchoole at <hi>Caeſaria,</hi> and was there in treated of the Biſhops there abouts, not onely to diſpute, but to <hi>open the ſcriptures alſo:</hi> The which thing <hi>Demetrius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Alexandria, (Origen</hi> his riuall) did greatly reprehend, when as notwithſtanding himſelf was the man, that had ſent him before into <hi>Arabia</hi> to the ſame end: neither yet did hee except againſt him, when hee was catechiſer in his owne church. But when as of mere enuy he cold no longer indure, that the renowmed fame of <hi>Origen</hi> ſhould daily increaſe, (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all manner occaſions to picke a quarrell againſt him) he laid blame in the Biſhops, that they would ſeeme to licence a Lay-man publikly to profeſſe the ſcriptures. To the which, his malitious cauils, <hi>Alexander</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Theodiſtus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſaria,</hi> make anſwere in theſe words. For that you vrge in your letters, that it was neuer hard of before nor is vſed as yet, <hi>that lay-men ſhould diſpute, and expound the Scriptures in the preſence of Biſhoppes,</hi> In that thing you ſeeme (I know not how) to auouch a manifeſt vntruth. For where fit and able men are found that may be any aid to the brethren in the word, they are requeſted of the holy Biſhops, that they would inſtruct the people in the ſame, <hi>as was</hi> Euſebius <hi>of</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, <hi>at</hi> Larandy, Paulinus <hi>of</hi> Celſus, <hi>at</hi> Iconium, <hi>and</hi> Theodorus <hi>of</hi> Atticus <hi>among the</hi> Synadines, <hi>all the which were bleſſed &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bretheren and it is verie likely, (although it bee vnknowen to vs)
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8306:68"/> that the ſame thing is done in other places.</hi> Thus for <hi>Euſebius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, albeit the Primatiue churches had not their vniuerſity ſchooles, like vnto thoſe we haue at this day: yet, that they were not altogeather without ſchooles, <hi>Alexandria</hi> alone is witneſſe ſufficient, which brought out Doctors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Origen, Pantaeus</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Neither is it to be doubted, but that cuſtome alſo was deriued from the Apoſtles. We know the knowledge of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to bee the gift of Gods ſpirite; but ſhall that therefore take away the exerciſes and the traueils of deuoted ſtudents: Amongſt the people of God, the Prophets had their Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in the which <hi>Samuell</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Elizeus</hi> and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were Maiſters: neither was it any diſparagement for the other Prophetes to liue vnder their diſcipline. God was neuer the authour of tumultuous confuſion, but of order, nor were the men of God, a company of furious bedlames, but a ſocietie of ſage and wiſe men, of a milde and a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſpirite. They which at this day holde ſchooles, and their orders in contempt, are franticke in their owne conceit, and ignorant of al good ſocietie and godly ciuilitie: nor do they know (nor can they conceaue) what infinite good they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe in all eſtates. Who can ſufficiently commend the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious purpoſe of thoſe men, which were the firſt founders of Vniuerſities? Are they not the fruitfull ſeminaries of all good litterature, and the holſome nurſes of al honourable virtues? The which being taken away, all humanity and ciuill curteſie would languiſhe togeather: and not that onely, but within a ſhort ſpace we our ſelues, nowe learned and religious, ſhould ſtrangely degenerate into minds and manners more ſauadge and barbarous, then are any of the nations. But no neede I ſhould digreſſe any further into the praiſe of our well renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Vniuerſities: onely this I ſay, that the Doctors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers they ſend forth into the Church of Chriſt, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer els, by their priuate labours, and diligent traueils in the ſcriptures haue attained to the knowledge therof, ought not by any means to take vpon them any thing in the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the good will, or without the good leaue of their BB.

                  </gap> why? They are priuate men, &amp; vnder their gouernance. But yet, being requeſted, or commanded by them, (as of old, ſo nowe) they may profeſſe: alwaies remembred, that they doe it for the good of the church. A degree of the vniuerſity, or any other teſtimony of learning, ought not to impair the authority of the Paſtors, or to diſturbe the good order of the Church.</p>
               <p>That at this day they which are created Doctors, are for the moſt part Elders: I doe not miſlike it; for of olde alſo it was but a very rare and extraordinary thing, for lay-men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the woorde publiquelie. But time, place, and neceſſitye may limite this matter, and preſcribe an order therevnto, not to bee ordered by head-ſtrong and deſperate temeritie. Yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt here take heed, leaſt they preſuming for their learning vpon the Vniuerſities teſtimony, they ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke, that they are already adopted into the orders of the holy miniſtery; (vnleſſe they be otherwiſe ordained then ſo:) the which I would haue thought ſcarſe worthy the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, were it not that I haue found ſome to farre ouerſhot in this error.</p>
               <p>There are alſo ſome others at this day, who diſclaiming the office of Paſtors, and that ordination which is ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Biſhops, will notwithſtanding be accounted Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the church: but to baptiſe, to miniſter the ſacraments, to viſite the ſicke, to bury the dead, to read publique prayer in the Church, they think it ſtands not with their credit. And why? For ſooth becauſe they ſee theſe parts of the miniſtery performed, ſometimes by ſome not deeply learned. Againe, there are other, which thinke it no ſmal part of reformation, that euery church ſhould haue with their Paſtor a Doctor: as if (good men) one Paſtor, (who of duetye is alſo a Doctor,) could not diſcharge both parts. Many ſuch fancies I witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omit, and recount them amongſt the wel-pleaſing dreams of ſuch as learne to feed themſelues: whome verely I cannot ſo well like of. For albeit I confeſſe, that certaine Doctours publiquely profeſſed in the Church, which were not Paſtors: yet I find, how that was vſed in the Apoſtles times of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8306:69"/> and afterwards very extraordinarily, &amp; onely then, when either the vrgent neceſſity, or the preſent commodity of the Church did ſo require. For the ordinarye Doctours of the church, are the Biſhops themſelues, who if they could ſuffiſe to perform al duties alone, they needed nor Elders nor Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to ioyne with them. We know how in a ſmall Church one Elder is enough: And that the greatnes, and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Churches, made this diuerſity of miniſters, both for order and number. But if anye man deſire to ſee more of this argument, he may read the writers of this age: Theſe thinges (as I thinke) may ſerue for this turne: who purpoſe not to treat of euery thing exactly, but onely to ſhew what I find wanting in ſome Churches, which would ſeeme the beſt reformed. To the which end, I haue recounted vnto you the <hi>diuers degrees of the miniſters of the church,</hi> euen as they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of the Lord, and deliuered of the Apoſtles, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of our firſt fathers, and Apoſtolik predeceſſors. In whoſe foot-ſteps we may more ſafely continue, then by not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſelues therin, to intangle our proceedings in ſome other new and ſtrange extrauagants.</p>

For the lewdnes, (I might ſay the irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) of ſome men in this our age, doth of force compell me ſomewhat more earneſtly to lay to their charge, the neglect dutie of ingrate mindes towardes Gods Miniſters; whome while they depriue of their due honour, they bring Religion it ſelfe into deepe diſdaine, and withall they bewray that they make no great account of God himſelf, whoſe Legats they depraue. For there be, which think it were not a poinct matter, if they were not left woorth a poinct: and thinke it neuer the worſe for the common-welth, if they had no place
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8306:71"/> at all in the common-wealth. Becauſe (forſooth) it is ſaid of our Sauiour &amp; his Apoſtles, that they renounced all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honours; therefore are they thought worthy no honour in the world; any vile or vulgar eſteeme (if ſo bee they may haue that) is enough for them, leaſt haplie they ſhould bee exalted in their owne ſence, and become proud of nothing. Thus they thinke none worthie of honour, that either doe not affect it, or are not infected with it. This errour is to bee confuted in this diſcourſe: in the which it ſhall bee ſhewed, that by all rights, both of God and man, the ſacred miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in a well ordered common-wealth hath alwaies beene had in greateſt honour and eſtimation amongſt all nations, and, that Chriſtians (aboue all others) doe owe no leſſe to their Paſtors, then did of olde the people of God to their Prieſts.</p>
               <p>Albeit the life of man bee inuolued and ouer-caſt with darke and thicke miſtes of errour and ignoriunce, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that manie times it is dazeled at the view and ſight of ſuch thinges, which of themſelues are cleare enough: notwithſtanding there are yet ſome thinges ſo cleare and ſo manifeſt, as in the which no man (beeing not ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe or beſotted) can pleade or pretend any ignorance. Such are thoſe generall notions of ſinne, which GOD (the author of nature) hath imprinted and imprized in our heartes and mindes, as thinges which are ingendred and congenerate with vs: ſuch is Religion towardes GOD, loue towardes our parentes, and reuerence towardes our progenitors.</p>
               <p>And albeit the relique of God his Image, is many waies diſteyned in vs, ſince the attaindour of our firſt parentes, yet is it not altogether deſtroyed; there alwayes remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch a reſplendent light of that diuine nature, as by the which men might naturally and clearely ſee, both what was good, and what was not good; and conceaue in ſome ſort alſo, what was godly, and what was godleſſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the Gentiles aberred from the true knowledge of the Godhead, and the true worſhip thereof: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8306:71"/> in this one thing they were well reſolued, that there was a GOD, and that hee was to bee honoured. Their Religion was depraued by them, yet were not they depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of Religion: but now, where it is come to that paſſe, that men thinke eyther that there is no God, or no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe of God: there the minde may bee ſayde, not to erre, but to raue: for they alone offend againſt that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, which is ingrauen in the mindes of all men, and which ingrafteth a voluntarie Religion, and a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclination, (will they, nill they) in the heart of euerie man. Nor was there euer Nation ſo barbarous, nor was there euer people ſo ſauage, which could liue without Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: take away Religion, and take away all ciuilitie from men, all ſeueritie from lawes.</p>
               <p>There are many partes in a common-wealth, vnto the which for great cauſe, there are great honours giuen: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to proweſſe Martiall: of the which albeit the vſe bee great, yet is it for no great time: But the vſe of Religion is eternall: There may bee a ſtate without a Soldiour, not without a Miniſter: The vſe of a Soldiour is farre from perpetuall, the leſſe, the better; the more ſeldome, the more welcome; but Religion is euerlaſting, and can neuer bee caſſeered. But what ſhould I compare the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of Religion with other myſteries in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which all haue their deſerued honours? They all muſt vnuaile to Religion, whether you reſpect the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, or the neceſsitie, or the commoditie of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie. Wherefore, that ſo notable and neceſſarie a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the ſtate, ſhould want honour in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it wanteth common reaſon.

To which ende they were exerciſed from their youth in all learned and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall ſciences: they did comprehend the motions of the heauens, and deuined by the errours of the ſtars: they read, and learned, and taught Religion, rites, and lawes: they were compeers with kings in their gouernment, ſo that, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done without their councel and conſent. Finally, of ſo great eſteeme was the diſcipline of the Wiſe-men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> as that hee was not thought worthy the Empire, that was not found skilfull in theyr Artes and Emblemes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſeus</hi> was the firſt that put a difference betweene No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles (whom he called <hi>Patritians</hi>) and husband men, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers: to the Nobles hee gaue power and preheminence to profeſſe religion, to chuſe Magiſtrates of their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and alſo to moderate and interprete in matters ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and diuine. This law their poſteritie, as they receiued it of their anceſtors, ſo they obſerued it very religiouſly: By which meanes it came to paſſe, that great reuerence was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies giuen, both to the ſacrifices, and to all other their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious actions. Neither could their Prieſts want their due parts of that diuine reuerence, whom they alwayes ſelected out of the nobleſt families, and who were euer one in their publique Councels. For, as if God himſelfe was preſent (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom we ought not to thinke that there is any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne) euen ſo in the preſence of the ſacred Prieſtes, did they propound all their more ſerious actions; namely, the diuines among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the ſouth-ſayers ſitting in counſell with the King among the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strabo</hi> in his twelfth booke writeth of two Temples ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to <hi>Bellona,</hi> which were called <hi>Comana:</hi> of whom the one was in <hi>Capadocia,</hi> the other in <hi>Pontus,</hi> both alike in all partes: for that indeede they were one made by the other, and had altogether the ſame rites and ceremonies common to them both. In thoſe places, either of the Prieſtes were in greateſt regard of honour next vnto the King himſelfe: and albeit they were ſubiect to the prince, yet where the people ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8306:74"/> them. They had either of them ſix thouſand ſeruants which were called <hi>Hierodulists,</hi> or <hi>Church ſeruants,</hi> beſides no ſmall quantitie of land, ouer the which they were <hi>free Lords.</hi> Twiſe euery yeare did the Prelate were a diademe; the Prince and Prieſts, for the moſt part, being of the ſame family. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> in his booke <hi>deregno</hi> confirmeth theſe thinges, and ſayth, that it becommeth all men to conceiue honourably of the Prieſts and Prophets, and that they ought of right to be had in great eſtimation, as wel for the greatnes of their actions, as the honour of their office. Wherefore (ſaith he) in Aegypt it is not lawfull for that King to ſway the ſcepter, that holds not of the Croſyer. Inſomuch, that if any, either by proweſſe, or by policie haue inuaded the kingdom, who is not of that holy kind, notwithſtanding afterwards (there is no remedie) he muſt be initiated into that myſtery. And not there only, but in many places amongſt the Graecians alſo, a man may find, where the chiefe ſacrifices are committed to the chiefe Magiſtrates. Neither is this which I maintaine, leſſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt among your ſelues: for you alſo aduance the moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent rites (eſpecially the auncient ſacrifices) to him, that by lotte is choſen your King. The ſame Philoſopher in his twelfth Dialogue <hi>de legibus,</hi> ſpeaketh much of that honour, which then, and of old was giuen vnto Prieſtes, both deade and liuing, as well in their publike aſſemblies, as at their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne funerals.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> were no whit inferiour eyther to the Greeks, or to the Aegyptians in this behalfe: for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ioyned the ſacred Prieſthood with the royall Maieſtie. All the firſt Kings of the <hi>Latins</hi> &amp; <hi>Romans</hi> were Prieſts. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors alſo, which afterwards ſucceeded them, would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues be the high Prieſts. But what reuerend regard the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> themſelues had of Religion, <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> hath left recorded in theſe words: <hi>But ſuch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was the care our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had, not only for the preſent account, but alſo for the future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of religion, that euen then when the Cittie was most floriſhing fortunate, they deliuered ten ſonnes, princes of the Senate, to the ten ſeueral prouinces and people of</hi> Hetruria, <hi>onely to this end, that they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8306:74"/> might learne the ſacred diſcipline of their Religion.</hi> But what the authority of diuines was at <hi>Rome,</hi> we may beſt heare by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine. <hi>Tullie</hi> in his ſecond <hi>de legibus</hi> writeth thus: <hi>The greatest and the worthiest thing in the Common-wealth, is the priueledge and preheminence of</hi> Diuines, <hi>ioyned with the greateſt authoritie: Neither doe I conceaue thus, becauſe I my ſelfe am a</hi> Diuine, <hi>but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it becommeth vs all ſo to conceaue: For indeed, what greater thing is there, (if we ſpeake according to the equitie and right of the thing) then with authoritie, either to diſmiſſe the companies, and the councels of chiefe Empires and the greateſt Potentats, when they are propoſed: or to reſtraine them, when they are concluded? or what thing can there be more ſolemne, then to ceaſe from the affaires wee haue already in hand, if one</hi> Diuine <hi>alone, doe but ſay the contrarie? VVhat thing can there be more magnificent, then of his intire power to appoint, that the Conſuls ſhould depoſe themſelues from their Magistracie? Or what thing more religious, then to giue leaue, or not to giue leaue, to deale with the people, or not to deale? And what is it to repeale lawes, not lawfully made? that nothing can be allowed to be done by the Magiſtrat, in peace or in war, without their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie?</hi> Thus farre goeth <hi>Cicero,</hi> whoſe authority I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme with many examples, if need were. But what ſhould I ſpeake of the Flamines and Arch-flamines, and other the Prieſtes, and Arch-prieſtes of the <hi>Romaines?</hi> It ſuffiſeth, they thought the Imperiall maieſtie it ſelfe to bee adorned with the honour of <hi>Hie-priest.</hi> But that all the ſocieties of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> were in eſpeciall honour among the <hi>Romains,</hi> it might verie wel be knowen, if it were but by this, that all the companies of Prieſts, had their places in publik triumphs, and ſolemne ſpectacles, (the chiefe Prieſts and the chiefe Curates:) <hi>There ſet</hi> (ſaith <hi>Arnobius) fifteene men crowned with lawrel wreathes, &amp;</hi> Iupiters <hi>Arch-prieſts with their myters: there ſet the Diuines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretors of the mind and will of God,</hi> as doe alſo the chaſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, nurſes, and nouriſhers of the neuer <hi>dying fire.</hi> Of theſe thinges, hee that deſireth greater variety, may ſeeke them in the Romaine hiſtory: theſe things ſuffice me.</p>
               <p>But nowe I will trauell ouer the Alpes, and will ſet before your conſideration, what religion was of olde amongſt the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8306:75"/> French and Britones, and what honour for religion. And firſt, it is ſufficiently knowen, that the <hi>Druidists</hi> were Prieſts of the chiefe nations on this ſide the Alpes: of whome wee read in <hi>Caeſar</hi> his Commentaries, that they were had in great eſteeme, for ſo hee writeth: <hi>In all Fraunce there are two ſortes of thoſe, which aboue the reſt are of eſpeciall honour and account: The one are the</hi> Druidiſts, <hi>the other are the men at armes. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in diuine ſeruice, they attend vppon ſacrifices priuate, and publike, they are the expounders of Religion: Vnto them great flocks of youth recourſe for their learning, and theſe haue eſpeciall honour among them. For they doe determine of all controuerſies (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) both priuate and publique: and if there bee any crime commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, any murther attempted, if any controuerſie, about inheritance, or the bounds of lands, they alſo ſet downe their decree, and appoint the penaltie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any perſon, either priuate or publique, will not ſtand to their cenſure, they lay the cenſure of the church vppon him, they excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune him the Church: this is the greateſt puniſhment among them. But who ſo are thus excommuned, they are forth-with accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of the graceleſſe and vngodly:</hi> they are forſaken of all men, al men flie their companie and their conference, leaſt by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagion they might take any infection, nor are they to haue any law if they deſire it, nor is there any honor to be giuen them, though they deſerue it. But ouer all theſe <hi>Drui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts,</hi> there is one as chiefe &amp; principal, which hath the chiefe authority among them, &amp;c. More-ouer, theſe <hi>Druidists</hi> vſe not to be preſent in warre, neither doe they pay any tribute with other men, but haue an exemption from warres, and an immunity from all other incumbraunces. Thus witneſſeth <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe. By the which wee may ſee, howe all nations eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that light of nature, which yet glimpſeth in the breſts of men, and by the which they haue eſteemed, either GOD or Gods to be adored, haue likewiſe iudged according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame, that the ancients of religion are worthy to be conſacred with all condigne honor and due obſeruance.</p>

Among the people of God, the Hie-prieſt had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the ſecond place next vnto the King. Among the more ancient and antique fathers, when as yet there was no lawe written, whereſoeuer true religion did flowriſhe, the firſt-borne had alwaies this prerogatiue of honour in their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies aboue the reſt of their brethren, <hi>Hee was graced with the Prieſt-hood.</hi> But if at any time, the Lorde of his abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, did tranſlate the right of the firſt-borne vnto the younger brother, with all hee inueſted him alſo into the ſame dignity of the Prieſt-hood: ſo came <hi>Iacob</hi> to bee prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</p>
               <p>And this cuſtome continued with the people of God, euen vnto the age of <hi>Moſes,</hi> vnder whome, by the expreſſe commaundement of God, the Prieſt-hoode was tranſlated from the firſt-borne in generall, vnto the tribe of Leuie. But now howe carefull God himſelfe was of this; That his Prieſt ſhould be honoured, the proceſſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> his hiſtorie can ſufficiently teſtifie: neither is it needfull for me to delate al things at large: it ſufficeth to haue noted the chief grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds Only this is not to be omitted, (beſides that our God wold haue him repreſent our hie and thriſe honored Prieſt, <hi>Christ Ieſu,</hi> that the rights which of dutie belong vnto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: God (as an eſpecial fauor) he hath giuen to his Prieſts,

And laſt of all, hee appointed them onely, the diſpenſation both of diuine and humaine lawes: in honor whereof, he did by law enact, that the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Hie-prieſt ſhould be held ſacred and inuiolable in all controuerſies: vnto the which, if any man were ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate as not to ſupply, his death was the lieu of his contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Elders which rule well in the Church are worthy of double honor, (according vnto the ſaying of Saint <hi>Paule</hi>) all that will be accounted chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, doe confeſſe in wordes; but when it once commeth vnto deedes, they can hardly award them a ſingle (God knowes) and a ſimple honour. But verelie, if there bee a meed, due for euery merite, then doubtleſſe there is an eſpeciall dutie to be yeelded vnto the Miniſters of the church. Doth not the onely regard of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty decree, that Parents ſhould haue of their children, the merite of their education? Lawyers of their clyents, the fees for their counſell? Phiſitions of their patients, the reward for their direction? the Tutor of his people, the ſtipend for his inſtruction? But who ſo faithfullie adminiſtreth vnto
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8306:76"/> the faithfull ſeruantes of God in ſacred thinges, he doth largely containe all theſe benefites in one; Seeing that God hath impoſed vppon the Paſtors of the Church the perſons of all theſe. For which cauſe doubtles, the irreligion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of ſome Magiſtrats in this age is worthy the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſhonor: who while they will ſeeme to be fauourites of chriſtian Religion, defeat the Miniſters thereof of theyr due Honor, &amp; ſo far are they from imparting any thing of their owne thereunto, that what ſo euer of old hath beene conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to ſacred vſes, they are ready to diſtract vnto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Miniſteries. Theſe men, that they may ſeeme to haue ſome colour for theyr craft, will cunningly reaſon the caſe thus: That there is not the like regard to be had of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Goſpell in this age, as was of old of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood vnder the law of <hi>Moyſes:</hi> That God did cocker them in thoſe Honors he ſpared them: but the Miniſters of the Goſpell are out of that age, they are paſt ſeuen, they may ſhift for themſelues, and learne to liue in the world, poore and inglorious. And of this Chriſt gaue them a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (and his followers the Apoſtles) who of purpoſe did chooſe a poore life, and neglected the honors and pleaſures of this world. Beſides all this, they preach to vs the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of earthly things: why ſhould they not lead the other way them ſelues, which they lay out vnto others.</p>
               <p>This you heare is a popular and plauſible ſpeech, well pleaſing all greedy and miſ-begetting men, who regard not ſo much that the Church may be furniſhed with godly and learned Miniſters, ſuch as Chriſt requireth; as, that vnder this colour, they them ſelues may be excuſed of theyr irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious contempt of Gods ſeruants, and theyr ſacriligious imbecilling of Gods Church. But theſe men being obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their baſe conceite, ſeeme for their fained and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected religion, not vnlike vnto thoſe, who with a counter-contempt of wealth, hunt currant after hid treaſure, that ſo they may make a gaine of their beggery, and a ſweete ſmell of theyr druggery. The nature of Cynicks is not clean worne out, together with the name: nor yet the cowherdly affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:8306:77"/> of thoſe, that thinke fryerly beggarlines, to be Apoſtolique holines. Doe you not ſee here, how the ſame error hath put on ſundry ſhapes, leaſt by any means he himſelfe ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in it, whom no man liketh in his own likenes? In deed the very colour of contemning thoſe thinges, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly al men do admire (as pleaſures, riches, and honors) doth bring the ſimple people into a religious wonderment; who for the moſt part worſhip with greater reuerence the bare counterfeit of vertue, then vertue it ſelfe, which cannot counterfeit. But if ſo be they do (as they ſay) ſo greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the imitable vertues of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; why doe they not alſo take view of thoſe forward chriſtians in the Primatiue Church, and goe preſently and ſell all theyr landes, and lay the price at the Apoſtles feete?</p>
               <p>But now I muſt haue a ſaying alſo to thoſe other colours, which they lay on, to countenance this error, leaſt the mind being fore-ſeaſoned with preiudice, ſhould auerre an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued truth without iuſt triall. For my part, I will not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceale any of thoſe things, which are layd to our charge by the patrons of this Hypocriſy. Wherefore (ſay they) as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do bring with them certaine prouocations to ſin, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the ſame: ſo pouerty is the mother of all vertue, and the ſtepdame of all vice. For that brideleth &amp; bringeth vnder the vntamed wildnes, and wilfullnes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſinfull nature. And that this is ſo, the aduiſed ſentence of the beſt Philoſophers confirme the ſame. For when as they (gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouer themſelues to the ſtudy of Philoſophy) were not ignorant, that worldly wealth would be but theyr hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they ſpared not either to leaue them, or to loſe them. The Euangelike precepts ſubſcribe together to this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which in euery place doe incite vs to the lothing of riches, to the liking of pouerty, and more then that, they do euen thunder out againſt the rich the woes of all wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Contrariwiſe our Sauiour promiſeth his bliſſe to the poore, and affirmeth, that it is more eaſie for a Cammell to daunce through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to aſpire to the kingdome of Heauen. Did not him ſelfe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8306:77"/> chooſe to be borne poore, to liue poore, to dye poore? of him ſelfe he ſayd, The birds of the ayre haue neſts, and the foxes haue holes, but the ſonne of man hath not where to put his head. Alſo if he entertayned any into his diſcipline, the firſt leſſon was to ſell al they had, and giue to the poore. For that in deed, riches, are but as certayne ſhakels to ſuch as follow Chriſt, with which they being intangled, can not poſſibly keepe pace with him. Neither can the minde ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with the burden of externe things, mount vp and ſoare aloft into the higheſt Heauens. Moreouer to theſe it is more probably added, that in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> there was a voice heard from Heauen, which ſayd, <hi>That poiſon was infuſed into the Church.</hi> The which was thought to be vttered becauſe of thoſe riches, &amp; that great wealth, with the which the godly Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> is ſayd to haue honored the Paſtors, and Biſhops of the Church. But theſe things you muſt conſider are commonly trikt vp and ſet forth after the fineſt faſhion, and with the beſt ſide outward; and yet how many abſurd things, and abſonant from the mind and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Lord and Sauiour do follow out of theſe, and fall vppon heapes.</p>

               <p>The cauſe of this error, was the miſ-conceyuing of that place in <hi>Mathew,</hi> the nineteenth, and <hi>Luke</hi> the eighteenth, &amp; <hi>Marke</hi> the tenth, where there ſeem to be two diſtinct things ſet down, namely, an ordinary way to eternall life, by the obſeruance of Gods commaundements, and another more perfect and ready way, by the alienation of all our goods, &amp; the diſpenſation of them towards the poore. In <hi>Mathew</hi> we read how our Sauiour aunſwered one; <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commaundements.</hi> Who when he had very inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently boaſted, that he had kept them all from his youth vp: how far he was from that perfection he boaſted of, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour proueth, when he brought to light the ſecret corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a couetous heart, which lay hid within, and made knowen to him, how far he was from the intire loue of his neighbour, when he commaunded him to ſell his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and giue to the poore. In the which notwithſtanding, our Sauiour required of him no new thing, no thing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, nothing that hee was not bound to doe by that ſame law, which he preſumed he had performed: (ſeing ther it is commaunded that we ſhould loue our neighbour as our ſelues.) For the force of the precept is this, that we owe not onely all outward thinges to God and our neyghbour,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8306:78"/> but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our life alſo, if need doth require. Of the which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, how much this ſtripling wanted, he then bewraied, when as Chriſt commaunding him to giue but his goods to the poore, he ſeemed to be touched ſo neare. And yet vnles we be at that point with our ſelues, as that we could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al that we haue, for the meere loue of God and our neighbour, we can not enter into the kingdome of God. And therefore Chriſt did not propound vnto the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſie a free thing, the neglect whereof did not exclude from the kingdome of heauen; but a thing altogether neceſſary for him that would enter into it. And therefore when he did perceyue him depart away heauily after this precept, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Verily I ſay vnto you, it is harde for him which is rich to enter into the kingdome of Heauen; againe I ſay vnto you, it is more eaſie for a camell to goe through the eie of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> By which words it is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that no voluntary thing is propounded, the which if a man did performe, he ſhould do wel, if not, he ſhould not doe amiſſe (as it is to liue a ſingle life) but a thing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary for him that would be ſaued.</p>
               <p>But what then meaneth our Sauiour (ſay they) when hee ſayth, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, goe, ſell all thou hast, and giue to the poore.</hi> Seemeth he not to graunt, that the keeping of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God are ſufficient to eternal life, but not ſufficing to perfection? No verily: For that this was not the meaning of the Lord, his very wordes ſufficiently declare, but that in deede he ſpake of that perfection which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in the law; of the which the young man had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued an outward ſhowe, when as he wanted the inwarde ſubſtance. For doubtleſſe, he which is not ready and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to lay down al that he hath, &amp; to leaue his life bloud alſo for the loue of his neighbour, he can not be ſayd to loue his neighbour as himſelfe. And therfore, ſeeing he would needs know what he wanted, our Sauiour very wiſely reioined him to the neceſſary duty of <hi>charity.</hi> Wherfore this is the ſenſe of Chriſt his words. If thou wilt be a perfect obſeruer of the law in deede, and art deſirous to tread that path into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8306:79"/> life, which is layd out in the ſayd perfect, and abſolute performance of the law of God, keepe thoſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the loue of God, &amp; thy neighbour: goe thy waies, ſet thy things in an order, that thou maiſt be ready at all times to giue vnto the poore.</p>
               <p>Now, vnleſſe this precept did concern al, to what purpoſe are theſe words, <hi>It is more eaſie for a Camell to enter through the eie of a needle, then for him that is rich to enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Whoſoeuer therfore wil ſerue vnder Chriſt his colours, is commanded to bid father &amp; mother and all farewell, how deare ſo euer they be vnto him, yea he muſt alſo not ſpare his own life; for vnto all it is ſayd, <hi>Whoſoeuer forſaketh not al he hath, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> That our Sauiour here inioyned his Diſciples no new or inſolent thing, the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> may perſwade vs, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God of old alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, to leaue his countrey, his kindred, &amp; al that was precious vnto him in Chaldea, that he might goe, whether it pleaſed the Lord to appoint him. So did God exerciſe the father of the faithful; that he might be alwaies at an howrs warning to ſurrender his riches, &amp; al other emoluments of his life. In like manner Chriſt wil haue al the true legitimat children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to depute all which they haue to his glory, and to benefit theyr bretheren, as the cauſe, the time, and the place require. And this is that perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which God at this day requireth vnder the Goſpel, and which God of old exacted vnder the law, &amp; before the law, without the which no man at any time ſhall enter into the kingdome of Heauen. In deed it becommeth the preachers of the Goſpel, to appeare before all others in the contempt of worldly things: but yet there is no peculiar precept thereof giuen to them, any otherwiſe then to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chriſtians. As alſo for the example of Chriſt which they aledge, they cannot be ignorant of this, that it is ſet forth to be imitated, not only of the apoſtles &amp; miniſters of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but generally of al chriſtians of what condition ſoeuer. But nor patterne nor precept of Chriſt, either confoundeth or controleth the degrees of honor which are neceſſary in a common wealth. All men may lawfully be liberall towardes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8306:79"/> the poore, and be poore themſelues alſo in ſpirit, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the midſt of their welth. Nor <hi>Daniel</hi> his lieutenancy ouer the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, nor <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer the Aegyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor <hi>Mardochai,</hi> nor <hi>Nehemias</hi> their courting among the Perſians, were any hinderance to them in the worſhip of God: Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was yet the roiall Diademe of <hi>Dauid</hi> and other godly Princes any preidiudice vnto them, why they might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite the kingdome of Heauen. Wee haue read of the great wealth of <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and other Patriarches, who were religious towardes God, liberall towardes the poore, and farre from all coueteouſnes. Neyther doth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury conclude, neyther doth plenty exclude the contempt of riches. If a man haue nothing, and yet languiſhe in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to haue, he is couetous; againe, if a man haue much but yet is not bound to that which he hath, he is the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of all that he hath.</p>
               <p>The precepts of Chriſt, concerning the ſelling of our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, are vnderſtood to be obſerued, not ſo much in the work it ſelfe, as in the willingnes of minde to performe the ſame, according as time and place doth require.<note place="margin">Actes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So long as the Lord liued (whom alſo he followed) he kept poſſeſſion of all his poſſeſſions. In like manner, ſuch times may fall (and we may fal into thoſe times) in the which chriſtian charity ſhal require euery chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to do the like: but where ther is no ſuch need, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kept, and it ſhall doe more good and vppon more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, then if all were ſold at once, &amp; afterwards want wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to relieue other, or themſelues, &amp;c. I dare ſay, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iob,</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> followed the precepts of the Goſpel, &amp; good chriſtians are as well to imitat them as Chriſt, &amp; his Apoſtles. Our Sauiour himſelfe witneſſeth of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> that he was the child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in imitation of the faith which was in <hi>Abraham</hi> n: amely, when as he vndertook to giue halfe of that he had to the poore, &amp; to reſtore four fould wher he had defrauded. By which words of our Sauior, the vanity of that reaſon is conuinced, which affirmeth that God cockred
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8306:80"/> the Patriarches and the Leuitical Prieſts, (as a carnal people) in riches and honour, which thinges the Lord hath denyed to chriſtian Paſtors.</p>
               <p>In deede we will not deny, but ſome things were giuen in thoſe times of an eſpecial and a partiall fauor, and that God did winke at ſome things of old, which at this day he wil not ouer-ſee: For then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon error of al nations, had in ſom things inuaded the people of God alſo, (as in their many wiues and often diuorſes, &amp;c.) But, that God did not onely pamper the Fathers with things externall, and did not erect the minds of the faithful to things eternal, it cannot be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without a mouth of blaſphemy againſt God, and a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of iniury againſt the Fathers. Ther was the ſame faith of the Fathers, &amp; vs, the ſame doctrine of both the teſtaments: the time onely is altered, (ſuch things being fulfilled which fore-ſhewed of the Meſſias) in religion &amp; maners ther is no ſuch alteration. Who wil ſay (and not repent him) that thoſe moſt ſage &amp; wiſe Heroicks of that age, were ignorant of the nature of riches, &amp; the condition of this preſent life? name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were diffluent &amp; diſtruſtful, &amp; ſcarce worthy to be taken for goods; and that man ought to aſpire to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; more excellent good, which is certaine, and not to be ſuſpected, and ſtands vppon no die. The very Philoſophers knew theſe things, and argued very religiouſly of them: and did the diuine Prophets, the ſeruants of God conceiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more noble then theſe earthly things? nothing can be ſayd of purpoſe more abſurd. Wherfore let this opinion fly, and let vs reſolue vppon that which is certain: <hi>That ther is one way of life preſcribed to all men,</hi> and that, the onely one way of vertue, conſtant &amp; to be continued in al ages: For it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of God. And againe: <hi>That we may ſafely follow the Fathers,</hi> when they cannot be proued to haue erred from that courſe of life, which was preſcribed both to them &amp; to vs: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it were then lawfull among Gods people, for the Prieſts and Leuites to inioy riches, and to be adorned with honors, the ſame is alſo lawfull at this day for the Miniſters of the Goſpell in a chriſtian common wealth.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:8306:80"/>
               <p>As for the Philoſophers (which as they ſay) had riches in ſo light account: I alſo ſay, that the ſame thing is taught vs by Chriſt, after a more excellent maner, and that he is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the name of a Chriſtian, that doth not excell the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers in the ſame thing. For they both erred from the true ſcope, and beſides a vaine and popular applauſe, they gained nothing by their fooliſh and vnprofitable loſſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath Chriſt taught vs to caſt awaye our goods, but to giue them vnto the poore. Goods are receiued of God, for the vſe of man; &amp; they which are rich receiue them of God, not to looſe, but to laye out: but they, as if the thinges themſelues had beene euill, not of mans corruption, but of their owne condition, caſt them cleane away. When goods are called the <hi>prouocations of euill,</hi> you muſt vnderſtand that they are ſo called, not that themſelues are in fault, but they onely which abuſe them. Whatſoeuer God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is good, and hath ſome good vſe: that therfore one hath caſt all his wealth into the Sea, an other hauing conuaied all his ſubſtance into a few precious ſtones, cruſht them all vnto powder, it was an action of vaine and ridiculous applauſe, of no good vſe. But the precepts of Chriſt do direct vs to the loue of God and our neighbours, vnto whome wee owe all that we haue.</p>
               <p>The contempt which wee ſee in ſome curriſh Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and certaine ſmokie brethren of this age, is far from the loue, either of God, or of man: and it is well ſeene, howe farre it is eſtranged euen from that humanity, and humaine ciuility which ought to bee in men. But the pouertye of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, was of another kinde. Our Sauiour lead a priuate life with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his mother <hi>Mary,</hi> and got his liuing with labour and handy-worke, not with begging and loytering. He tooke care for his mother <hi>Marie,</hi> and alſo prouided for her according to that poore eſtate, which hee of ſinguler and eſpecial purpoſe had choſen. Neither could riches haue done him any hurt, if hee would haue poſſeſſed them: But that the leaſt occaſion of ſuſpicion might not be giuen to any, that hee aſpired to any earthly kingdome, his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8306:81"/> diuine purpoſe was to liue poore, and lie hid for a time: for if the world had knowen the Lord of glorie, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue crucified him: but that which a few wiſe men did, no doubt all the worlde would haue doone the like: they would haue brought preſents vnto him from the furtheſt parts of the world. And what would <hi>Tiberius</hi> (thinke you,) haue done amongſt the reſt: who (in glorious as hee was) canonized Chriſt amongſt the number of Gods, and tooke order with the Senate, that the ſame ſhould bee done by publique decree?</p>
               <p>After thirty yeares ſpace, he betooke himſelfe to preach, and within no great while, hee had no ſmall family: hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained firſt twelue Apoſtles, and after them ſeuenty other diſciples. For all the which he ſo prouided, as that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanted. And yet no ſmall portion could ſuffice to kepe ſo great a company, were it to find them but ſparinglie. By the which (as by the way) wee may geather, how great the bounty and liberality of good &amp; deuout men was towards Chriſt.</p>
               <p>That he maketh anſwere to a certaine curious compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and telleth him, <hi>That the birds of the aire haue neſts, and the Foxes holes, but the Sonne of man hath not where to put his head:</hi> the anſwere muſt be vnderſtood according vnto the conceit of the demaunder, not according to the bare words of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer. He expected ſome great commodity to be had by the retinue of Chriſt, and ſuppoſed hee could not be without ſome ſtately and magnificent receit. (For wee read in <hi>Iohn,</hi> that Chriſt ſhewed his houſe to a couple of his diſciples) But our Sauiour would allure no man vnto him with ſuch baits, as with the which moſt men are intangled, (as are honours and riches and ſuch like,) rather did he lay before him ſuch thinges, as with the which moſt men are moſt commonlie terrified (as are ſlaunders, and need, and dangers.)</p>
               <p>I marie ſir (will ſome ſay) therefore it beſeemeth not the Prelates of the church, and other miniſters of the goſpell, to rooſt aloft in Princely pallaces, and ſtately edifies. True in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if ſo be they were in like condition of time and place,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8306:81"/> as in the which our Sauiour liued: that is, if they liued vnder a Magiſtrate eſtranged from the true religion, who were like to be iealous ouer the true Meſsias and his Miniſters, leaſt they ſhould affect the kingdome, if he ſhould ſee them frol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in ſuch thinges, as by the which they might make ſome way vnto a kingdome, (as are great riches, ſtately pallaces, ſtrong townes, &amp; coſtly retinues:) and beſides, if they ſhuld conuerſe amongſt a people, which could conceiue no other kingdome of Meſsias, but ſuch as ſhould flowriſh in al ſuch royall enſignes. But the Lord by this his meane eſtate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted two things: Firſt he preuented the Iewes cauils, ſo that they could not iuſtly accuſe him for affecting the kingdome; and beſides, hee taught withall, that his kingdome had no inter-common with the kingdomes of this world: So that by the one, hee auoyded the enuy and iealouſie of ſome, and with the other hee confuted the common error of all, concerning this one kingdome of the Meſsias? If ſo bee there had bene no danger of theſe thinges, but the myſterie of our redemption might haue beene wrought as well with the ſuſpected pompe of externe maieſtie: no doubt the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of townes and towers and al external things, would not himſelfe haue refuſed them. For all the pallaces and Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the worlde ought of right to haue receiued the King Chriſt; when he came into the world, he came into his own; and the true heire came, not onely of his fathers kingdome, but alſo of the whole world. And therefore, that the blind and beſotted Iewes, did not intertaine him with that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which beſeemed him, their negligence therein is not to be imitated, for their vngodlines cannot any waies be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>I would they could but tell mee, with what triumphes, with what courteous and friendly intertainment our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhould haue beene receaued of the Romaine Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and theyr deputies, if hee had beene well knowen of the Hye-prieſts of the Iewes, and other Princes and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours which ruled the world; (if he had bene wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vnto them?)</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:8306:82"/>
               <p>The people, and ſo many as beleeued that hee was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſias, with what ſolemne clamors, and triumphant iubelies did they receiue him, and conuay him into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly citty? Thoſe honours and others which were giuen him, our Sauiour did not reiect them, but rather defended them as hee might, againſt the enuious. And had there bene that religion in the Hie-prieſts, Scribes and Phariſes, and the reſt of the Iewes which ought to haue bene; their duety was to haue thronged together for the receit of the Sauiour of the worlde, and to haue ſolemniſed the intertainement of the promiſed Meſſias, with all honour and reuerence which is due, &amp; might be done by men, not only to a mortall Prince, but to an immortall God. Wherefore, it is but a bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to argue from that which was done of error &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to that which ought to be done of right &amp; alegeance. Neither hath that any force to binde vs, which the Lord did of eſpeciall purpoſe extraordinarily, where as there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not now the like vſe of that purpoſe. That his wil was to be borne in an out roome, and to be found in a fowle ſtable, and that his owne decree was to bee crucified of the Iewes: it preſcribeth no law vnto vs, vnto the which wee are bound to obey. Neither is his example heerein to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but his purpoſe to be admired.</p>
               <p>And that which I ſay of our Sauiour, the like do I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme of his Apoſtles and other Miniſters, according vnto euery mans place. For as the eſtate of our Lorde and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, had beene after a far other ſort, if all men, or the Iewes at the leaſt, with whome hee did conuerſe, had but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that hee was the Lord of glory: So likewiſe doe I affirme, that the eſtate of the Miniſtery ought to be much more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vnder a chriſtian Magiſtrat, where Chriſt is wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, then vnder an Heatheniſh gouernment eſtranged from the knowledge of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As for the eſtate of pouertie, I hold as I haue proued, that the ſame which is commanded in the Goſpel indefinitlie, is inioyned all Chriſtians generally: Neither are the Prelates of the Church any otherwiſe bound thereto, then are the reſt.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8306:82"/> How many ſoeuer the Lord in his laſt iudgement ſhall find vpon iuſt account to haue liued rich (againſt whom he hath pronounced the woe of his eternall curſe) they all ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh euerlaſtingly: and they onely which ſhall bee found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poore in ſpirit (vnto whom the kingdome doth appertaine) ſhall liue eternally. The precept of Euangelike pouertie, which Chriſt followed, and left in charge to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of vs, is this; namely, <hi>Lowlines of minde,</hi> which is the moſt peremptorie contemner of al viſible things. The pore in ſpirit is he, which beareth not a hautie ſpirit, neyther ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereth after diſhoneſt deſires: which liueth content with his eſtate, and committeth his whole life vnto God: if hee haue nothing, or if it be little which hee hath, he is not ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited with diſquiet cares; but truſteth in God his maker, of whom he hopeth for his daily bread: Againe, if he be rich, his ſpirit is not exalted by reaſon of his riches, but well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth, that he brought nothing vnto this world, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall carrie any thing away: hee knoweth, that riches are but waſh, and waxe wayward, that they may eaſily bee tranſlated from him, that they may many waies periſh with him: he acknowledgeth, that he hath receyued them of the Lord, neither to be kept in ward, nor to be ſpent in waſt. All which partes of ſpirituall pouertie the Apoſtle requireth in his firſt to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the ſixt chapter, where he admoniſheth <hi>Timothie</hi> to exhort the rich vnto this pouertie: <hi>Charge them that are rich</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this world, that they be not high minded, that they trust not in vncertain riches, but in the liuing God (which giueth vs abundantly all things to enioy) that they doe good, and be rich in good workes, readie to distribute.</hi> Heere haue we that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie which our Sauiour requireth to be in rich men: which (as you may ſee) doth nothing at all inuert the vſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of earthly thinges. This I ſay is that pouertie, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vertue, which all the holy Patriarches and Prophets, with all the Apoſtles &amp; firſt Chriſtians, and laſt of all, which all the godly haue alwayes obſerued, and our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe both in word and deede, both in plentie and pouertie, taught to be obſerued. But is not this the verie Atheiſme of

                  <hi>Iulian</hi> the recreant, and the onely Saraciſme of the enemies of Chriſtian religion, when they haue robbed and rifled the Churches of their wealth and dignities, to inſult ouer the poore Miniſters, and to ſay, they ought to be poore after the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? As for that they fetch in the vncertaine ſound of a certain voice, heard in the time of <hi>Constantine:</hi> it is to be vnderſtood (if it be to be beleued) of <hi>Arrius</hi> and his inuenomed doctrine, not of the forged donations of <hi>Constantine..</hi> The wealth and riches which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> vouchſafed, could not bee offenſiue to the Church, ſeeing they were neither ſo great as they make them, nor yet ſeduced the Biſhops and Elders from their Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call functions, as they would haue them. But then, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding &amp; diſpoſing of them was after ſuch a ſort, as might eaſely cleare the Biſhops from all ſuſpition of auarice.</p>

In what things our Fathers (as we thinke) offended, we ſee verie clearely; but where wee offend our ſelues, we wil not grope with our hands: Lynces in other mens faults, Moules in our owne. That there is an honor due vnto Parents, Lawyers, Tutors, &amp; phyſitions, it is

For they are both Fathers, &amp; Tutors, &amp; Lawyers, and Phyſitions: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how much more they excell in worthines, ſo much more worthy to be preferred in worſhip. Beſides all this, the reuerence which is giuen to theſe and ſuch like, is, onely of curteſie &amp; common ciuilitie, and reſpecteth man onely, and our duties to men: but the honor which is due vnto Gods Miniſters, reſpecteth God himſelf, &amp; his heuenly miniſtery.

He which receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, ſhal receiue a Prophets reward; and he that receiueth a iust man in the name of a iuſt man, ſhal haue a iust mans reward: &amp; whoſoeuer ſhall giue drinke to one of theſe little ones, euen a cuppe of cold water onely in the name of a Diſciple, verely I ſay, vnto you, he shall not loſe his reward.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Philippians, calleth thoſe <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents</hi> which were ſent to him, an odour that ſmelleth ſweet; a ſacrifice acceptable and pleaſant to God. So that in the poore, whoſe wants we releeue, Chriſt is worſhipped, but in the Miniſters, whoſe calling we maintain, Chriſt is honored.</p>
               <p>The Leuitical ſacrifices haue had their end: but the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ſacrifices ſhal haue no end, vntil the worlds end.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt it ſhall not bee amiſſe for vs to ſee in this place, how farre out of all order the frenzie of certaine vngodly men will hurrie it ſelfe: who will not onely not deigne to contribute of their owne to the Miniſters, but they hardly vouchſafe them thoſe honeſt ſtipends, which they pay vnto them out of the robberies of their owne Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Out of that one example of <hi>Paule,</hi> they thinke they may ſet the Miniſter to plough and harrow, or whatſoeuer mannuarie drudgerie: that by this meanes, all ſacred ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die might languiſh, and the little flocke of Chriſt, being left deſolate of learned Paſtors, might lie open to the rapine &amp; torture of foxes, and cater-pillers, and wolues of all ſortes. There is no great neede (ſay they) of any great ſtore of <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> in a Miniſter: it is enough, if with a little zeale, and a few good wordes they can exhort the people to a certaine
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8306:84"/> kind of verbal deuotion: and for this, the Bible is extant in the mother toong: as for the deepe-ſprung-breſtes of the learned Muſes, it ſufficeth diuines, if they may get but a ſmacke of them by the way, or ſucke them as through an hardle. O diuine wiſedome, Chriſt, in thy Fathers boſome, is not this with that recreant <hi>Iulian,</hi> to enuy thy Chriſtian people the liberall Artes? And that which not? And thou ſeeſt it.</p>
               <p>But let vs returne to <hi>Paule,</hi> who in an Epiſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians recounteth of the labour of his handes, by the which hee got his owne liuing, as a prayſe to himſelfe, and a reproch to the Corinthians; ſhall it followe of this, that all Miniſters of the Goſpell ought to doe the like? for ſo they thinke. But now can not I tell, whether I ſhal rather diſclaim the impudencie, or diſdaine the ignorance of theſe men: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle himſelfe doth plainely reſolue, that hee did more in that caſe then he needed, and leſſe then hee might. For had he not as great right, to put them to as great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as did the other Apoſtles? But for certaine cauſes hee would not, and therefore ſpared them. But who ſeeth not heere, that this the commemoration of the Apoſtle, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine exprobation vnto the people of that dutie they negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? So long as that Epiſtle ſhall bee read among men, that ſhame will ſticke faſt to the Corinthians, that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo excellent an Apoſtle to want, in ſo plentifull a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Doubtleſſe therefore, it is but too too bad dealing both with <hi>Paule,</hi> and with vs, to vrge that which the Apoſtle was vrged to doe once or twiſe vpon occaſion of neceſſitie (that he might offend no man, or leaſt any being offended, ſhould ſay or thinke, he preached the Goſpell, not ſo much for the loue of religion, as for the hope of reward:) and to paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as neuer ſeene the more autentike examples of other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and of <hi>Paule</hi> alſo himſelfe, who elſe where openly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, that the Churches had abundantly miniſtred vnto him all thinges neceſſary, &amp; that hee alſo freely exacted the ſame thing of them, and that of dutie: (as in the fourth to the Philippians, from the tenth verſe to the twentie, and to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8306:85"/> 
                  <hi>Philemon,</hi> from the eight verſe to the nineteene. But what is the reaſon (may we thinke) that that one place of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes ſhould bee ſo much noted, which maketh mention of the labour of the Apoſtle his handes, and that notable place of the Actes ſhould bee ſo little ſpoken of, where it is reported, that the faithfull layde the price of their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the Apoſtles feete, and that they left all their ſubſtance in their handes? And why is not that example of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> as well quoted, who for detracting ſomewhat of the price of their owne landes, were ſeuerely puniſhed by preſent death? Ingrating couetouſnes no doubt, and irreligious ingratitude hath made them there, as quicke ſighted as <hi>Argus,</hi> but here as bleare-eyed as Oules, ſo that thereat they ſtare, herein they are ſtarke blind.</p>
               <p>But, that the intoxicate frenzie of theſe men may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the more outragious, it ſhall well requite our paines, if in this place we make regarde to the Euangelike precepts of Chriſt in this cauſe. In the tenth of <hi>Mathew,</hi> and the tenth of <hi>Luke,</hi> wee reade, and wee may remember, how the Lorde, when hee had ſent his Apoſtles to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, gaue them authoritie to feede vpon thoſe things that they found amongſt the faythfull. <hi>The labourer</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is worthie of his reward.</hi> And <hi>Paule</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi> the fift chapter: <hi>The Elders which rule well</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>are worthie of double honour, eſpecially they which labour in the worde and doctrine: For the Scripture ſaith; Thou ſhalt not muſsle the mouth of the Oxe which treadeth out the corne.</hi> And in his firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Corinthians the ninth chapter, from the fift verſe to the fifteene, he maketh a plaine and a plentifull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration by ſeuen ſeuerall argumentes, that they which preach the Goſpell, ought to liue of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>His firſt reaſon is taken from the Soldiour: That no man goeth to warre-fare of his owne coſtes and charges. The ſecond, is drawne from the huſbandmen: Who, if they plant a vine, it is reaſon that they ſhould eate of the fruite of the vine. The third is borrowed of the ſhepheard: Who feed their flockes, and are fedde by their flockes. And that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8306:85"/> no man ſhould thinke the Apoſtle ſpake of affection, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: <hi>Say I theſe thinges according to man?</hi> Namely, as a man moued with auarice, or carryed away with couetouſneſſe? Nay then he prouoketh of his ſide the law it ſelfe, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes inioyned vs a certaine ciuilitie, and ſemblable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes euen vnto brute beaſtes; (if they doe vs any ſeruice) that wee may well knowe, how much rather wee ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame towards men, I ſay towardes men, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all men, deſerue well of all men. And this is the fourth argument in that place: which he amplifieth by the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of him which ploweth, and threſheth out the corne, for the commoditie thereof. <hi>It is written in the law of</hi> Moſes (ſayth he) <hi>Thou ſhalt not muſsle the mouth of the Oxe, that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out the corne; Doth God take care for Oxen? eyther ſayth hee not this altogether for our ſakes? for our ſakes no doubt it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: that hee which eareth, ſhould eare in hope, and that he which threſheth in hope, should be partaker of his hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fift argument is drawne from them which ſowe corne, in hope to make a good harueſt: <hi>If we haue ſowne to you</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſpirituall thinges, is it a great thing if wee reape your carnall thinges?</hi> There is no proportion at all betweene theſe thinges; we giue you much greater things then we receiue of you.</p>
               <p>The ſixt argument is drawne from the diuine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, vnder the old Teſtament; becauſe it was then of the Lord ordained, that the Prieſtes and Leuites, ſo many as miniſter at the Altar, ſhould liue of the Altar: <hi>Doe you not knowe</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>that they which minister about holie thinges, eate of the thinges of the Temple? and that they which waite at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſt of all hee ſheweth, that the like inſtitution was ordeyned of the Lord, vnder the new Teſtament: <hi>That they which preach the Goſpell, shall alſo liue of the Goſpell.</hi> By which reaſons it is made as cleare as noone-day, that all Chriſtians are bound in dutie to honour their Paſtors. And how then ſhould they be excuſed of ingratitude &amp; vngodlines, which defraud them of their due honour?</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:8306:86"/>
               <p>That the contempt of the Miniſter redoundeth to God their Maiſter, and that no man ſo much as God himſelfe is thereby held in ſcorne, that one place in the ſixt to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians the ſixt verſe doth abundantly declare, which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort: <hi>Let him that is taught in the worde communicate with him that taught him, all his goodes. Bee not deceiued: God is not mocked; For whatſoeuer a man ſoweth, that ſhall hee alſo reape; for he that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall reape corruption, but hee that ſoweth to the ſpirite, ſhall of the ſpirite reape life euerlasting.</hi> Let him which is inſtructed (ſayth hee) communicate <hi>all his goodes.</hi> Good Lord (will ſome ſay) what meaneth he by this? What he meaneth may eaſily be vnderſtood by a <hi>Synecdoche:</hi> by the which he ſayth <hi>All his goods,</hi> for part of all his goods. How great a part, it is not preſcribed; vnto the old people the tenth part was layd forth; vnto the new people no part: ſeeing they owe of dutie vnto Chriſt their Lord and Sauiour, not the tenth onely, but the ninth, eight, ſeuenth, ſixt, fift, and euen the whole, and all, if the neceſſitie of the Church requireth ſo much. To this he addeth; <hi>God is not mocked:</hi> as if hee ſhould haue ſaide: It is but in vaine, that you make ſo many vaine excuſes: for here the queſtion is not of mans mainteinance, but of God and the Goſpels countenance: not what honour you ſhew to man, but what due regard ye yeelde vnto God: thinke not you pintch on the Parſons ſide, when God himſelfe is the partie; you may haplie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude them, but God will not be dallyed withall. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if wee could but once conceiue the leaſt part of that which all rich men, and Nobles, Barons, Earles, Dukes, and Kinges themſelues doe owe vnto the Miniſters of Gods Church; and that the ſame might once bee freely giuen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Gods lawes doe commaund, and the godly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a gratefull minde doth require: how great might we think would the treaſure of the Church be, in a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian common-wealth?</p>

               <p>Who doubteth of the liberality of the Primitiue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, (which brought the price of their lands to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,) but that they might as well haue giuen them the land it ſelfe, if the ſtate of the time and place had bene ſuch? But they which did then expect the ſubuerſion of that place and people, and looked for no better world vnder thoſe vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Prieſtes, then their Lorde and Sauiour had found before them, they thought good to ſell all, and onely of their meer bountie, (no man compelling them thereunto) they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted al the mony to be at the Apoſtles curteſie.

               <p>I am not ignorant that this religious action hath degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into a prepoſterous zeale: for which cauſe, (curteous reader) I giue thee to vnderſtand, that I do not here defend any godles, or ſuperſtitious donations, but onely note vnto thee the great vntowardnes of mans nature, which is alwais more prone to ruine into contrary enormities, then to run

Do you not know, that God will bee ſo worſhipped in ſpirite and truth, (that is, in mind and faith) that in the mean while, there be no want of extearne worſhip in the honour and homage of our bodies? For he is the maker and maintainer, both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule, and therefore of right hee is to be worſhipped in them both. And are not our bodies the temples of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which dwelleth in vs? In like manner, ſeeing hee is alſo the onely doner of all our wealth and worldly goods, of like right he requireth our duty, and his honor in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. Whereupon our Lord and Sauiour, being mooued in a caſe of paying tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> made this anſwere, <hi>That wee must giue vnto God, that which is Gods, and vnto Caeſar that which is due vnto Caeſar:</hi> ſhewing thereby, that there is a tribute due
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8306:87"/> to be paid vnto God alſo, as well as to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as a teſtimony of our loyall ſubiection to his diuine Maieſtie.

But now, the firſt of theſe hath no place in God, neither doth hee require any thing of vs in that behalfe: but the latter is ſo much the more due to God, by how much the more God is greater than man, and the profeſsion of ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is neceſſary in euery faithful chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Wherfore, after the Lord had appointed <hi>Iſrael</hi> a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people to himſelfe, forthwith, as Prince and chiefe Lord ouer his people, he demanded the tenth of all their increaſe, with orher rites and royalties of his ſupreame power; And wheras it was alwaies an heinous matter among the Eſterne Monarks, to appear before the King without a preſent: God required the like honor of his people; namely for that hee was both king and Lord ouer his people. For which cauſe, in the law, where all the males are commanded to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, they are forbidden to come neere without an offring. Moreouer, is there not yet extant in <hi>Malachy</hi> a ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rebuke againſt the Iewes, which practiſed deceit in their firſt fruits, and in their tythes? That ſacrilege the Lorde iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie puniſhed in them with the dire of a contagious dearth: the which notwithſtanding, hee promiſeth (if they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that fault) that hee would open the windowes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and powre out vppon them a gracious plentye of all thinges.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt it is excepted, that the times are alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: that at this day vnder the goſpel, the Prieſthood is tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated into Chriſt, whoſe ſhadow it was: that hee hath impoſed an end to all outward rites: by which means the right of tything, is alſo antiquated with the Prieſt-hoode, and all that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward glorie which made the antique Prieſts more honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is therwithall ecclipſed. Neither is there any man at this day which can arrogate to himſelfe (without impiety) thoſe auncient honours of the former prieſt-hood. Is it not rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred among the chiefe errors of Antichriſt, that he vaunteth and aduanceth himſelfe for Hic-prieſt? Becauſe that honour at this day, is proper and peculiar to Chriſt alone. In place of the auncient Prieſt-hood, which was accompanied with an externall and a religious maieſtie, our Sauiour hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Eccleſiaſtical miniſtery, baſe and abiect, in great diſgrace, and cleane out of countenance: And hath hee not giuen them their chriſtning alſo, according to their calling?</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:8306:88"/>
               <p>For therefore he gaue them the ſeruile names of Apoſtles, and Miniſters, and Deacons, and Biſhops and Paſtors, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide all titles of Honor and dignity, as are the names of Fathers, and Doctors, and Lords and ſuch like: that they might knowe, what they were to conceyue of them ſelues &amp; their Miniſtery, and that the people might likewiſe learne what reckoning to make of theyr paines, and theyr perſons.</p>
               <p>Here is a faire tale ſurely, and well ſoothed. But what of all this? that the Paſtors and Biſhops of Chriſt his Church, are worthy leſſe Honor in a chriſtian common wealth, then were of yore the Elder Prieſts? Why then let vs conclude with al a lya or too: that the leuitical prieſthood is more ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>norable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſts; &amp; that the miniſtery of the law is more glorious, then that of the Goſpell, then the which if there can be any aſſertion more abſurd, this concluſion of theirs ſhall goe for no bad confection. For if the Honor due to the Miniſter, be to be meaſured according to the outward ſhew, we may well conclude, that <hi>Aaron</hi> was worthy double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and our Sauiour the high Prieſt thriſe ſacred, none at all. For why? he was inueſtured with no mitre, no labels, nor did he gliſter with gold and precious ſtones. But let vs firſt take that they giue vs in good worth; (namely that the Prieſts of olde were to be honored with no ſmall obſequy) &amp; then let vs examine the caſe, what is to be deducted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from the Euangelique Miniſter.</p>
               <p>You are to vnderſtand therefore, that in moſt parts of the old ceremonies, many times two things did meete in one, which notwithſtanding were diuerſe and diſtinct in them ſelues: of which the one did containe the ſhadow and promiſe of that which was to be exhibited in Chriſt, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did pertayn to ſome proper and eſpeciall duety in the Church: the ſhadowes are ceaſed (thoſe things being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which in Chriſt were promiſed:) but the bond of eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial duty remaineth as yet not cancelled. For example ſake: the commaundement of keeping the Sabaoth, hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternall reſt, and a ſhadow of the reſt of our bodies the ſeuenth day; and beſides that, it includeth a morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8306:89"/> of ſeruing of God, and ceaſing from our labours. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precepts alſo do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain that duety of external worſhip, which is due vnto God, together with the rites of that time: the rites being relinguiſhed, the worſhip of God to be retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The like we may ſay of the Prieſthood, in the which ther were ſundry reſpects: Whatſoeuer was typical, was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Chriſt: but of the other partes which were morall, (namely ſuch as concerned the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people, the miniſtery of the Sacraments, &amp; the regiment of the church) the manner is changed, but the kinde remaineth: ther is not the like order in circumſtance, but the ſame ordinance in ſubſtance of the office. The chiefe parts of the Prieſts functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were theſe: to teach religion, to interprete the law, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church, to adminiſter the Sacraments, to ſtande between God and the people, to make ſacrifice, &amp; to purge ſins. All which parts, albeit our Lord and Sauiour hath only wholly diſcharged, and ſome of them alſo ſo peculiarly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued to himſelfe, as that they cannot be imparted with any mortall thing beſides him ſelfe: yet notwithſtanding he hath made many of them of that nature, as that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſparagement to his perſon they might be left in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to others. In deede no ſinner can bee made a ſufficient mediator between God and man. (Neyther can he which is not pure from the guilt of ſinne him ſelfe, expiat with bloud the ſinnes of man, or auert by death the wrath of God.) The auncient Prieſts bare the figure onely of thoſe more then diuine functions, but the thing it ſelfe was in Chriſt alone; And therfore whoſoeuer at this day ſhal challenge to himſelf the one of theſe, committeth blaſphemy againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But as the Lord did nothing in derogation of his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignity, when he gaue power vnto all chriſtians to offer ſpirituall ſacrifice, namely the ſacrifice of praiſe, and praier, &amp;c. (For al they which in a true faith worſhip God are made Kings and Prieſts:) euen ſo likewiſe, without any prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his peculiar Prieſthood, hath he committed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts thereof (which I touched before) namely the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of religion, the expounding of the law, the miniſtring
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8306:89"/> of the Sacraments, the gouerning of the Church, and ſuch like, I ſay he hath graunted and demiſed theſe and ſuch like parts of his diuine Prieſthood to his Apoſtles &amp; Chuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: who in this reſpect may participat the honor of the old Prieſthood without impiety, &amp; may alſo be called Prieſts without gealoſie. The which name although in the firſt age of the Church, we doe not read that it was giuen to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Church, leaſt happely the Miniſters of the olde Synagogue, &amp; the new Church might be confounded: (For as yet the old Prieſthood remayned, or the fleſh memory thereof continued) yet afterwards, the Fathers did not amis, when they renewed the ſame againe in themſelues, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay</hi> being their author, &amp; the ſpirit of God their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who diuined long before, that God ſhould raiſe to him ſelfe <hi>Prieſts</hi> &amp; Leuits out of the Gentiles. Neyther is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daunger at all in the name at this day, were it not for the ſacrilege of the Biſhop of Rome, who hath ſet vp Altar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Altar, &amp; Prieſthood againſt Prieſthood, &amp; the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, againſt the ſacrifice of Chriſt, inuading by all meanes thoſe partes of the Prieſthood, which are peculiar to Chriſt alone: of which matter we are not to ſpeake in many words at this time Briefly, this we deſire may be made kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to all, that we deteſt the impiety of the Romaine Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, &amp; for ſo much as pertaineth to this part of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, we acknowledge no other Prieſt but the Lord Ieſus. In the other parts (which we haue noted) wee hold, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles &amp; other Paſtors of the church, haue lawfully vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the dignity, as of their legacy, ſo of the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>Now then, I ioyne more choſely with them for the iſſue of their whole argument, &amp; anſwere, That whatſoeuer in the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall Prieſtood did fore-ſhadow the office of Chriſt, is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly aboliſhed by the bloudſhed of Chriſt, of the which no part may be vſurped by any mortall man: Againe, that the rites, ceremonies, &amp; outward pomp of the Prieſthood, as wel in the ornature of the body, as the ordinaunce of tithes (as they were then challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged) are togither deceaſed by the ſame meanes: but yet, that honor which was due to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in regard
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8306:90"/> of the worthines of theyr holy miniſtery, is by no means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, periſhed much leſſe. The Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> being abrogated, the rights of that Prieſthood after their ſeuerall manner are alſo abrogated, and with them the miniſtery of the Church is tranſlated from the Tribe of <hi>Leuy,</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors. In whom ſeeing all things which merit any Honor, are greater then they which were in the Leuiticall Prieſts, doth it not neceſſarily follow, that a chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth owe no leſſe honor to his Paſtor, then the Iew did perform to his Prieſt? I confeſſe the duty of tithes &amp; oblations (after that manner and order they were offered vnder <hi>Moyſes</hi>) are ceaſed vnder Chriſt. Not that chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be leſſe bounteous towardes their Paſtors, then were the Iewiſh nation towards their Prieſts; but rather, that the free people ſhould exceede the ſeruile, and that a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould doe that of his owne accord, which the Iew did by conſtraint. For where as chriſtians haue receyued of the Lord, not onely the like graces, but farre greater bleſſings then the Iewes: and ſeeing the Miniſtery of them whom the Lord hath ſet ouer his church, is in nothing inferior, or leſſe neceſſary then the Miniſtery of the law, of force, if not rather of duety, there remaineth as great a neceſſity of due honor for this, as for that; at the leaſt no leſſe: ſeeing that what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer was ceremonious in the olde oblations of tithes and offerings, is ſo diminiſhed, as that what ſo euer was morall therein, reteyneth his force ſtill. Had there been no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between both theſe Miniſteries, &amp; the neceſſary duties of them both, the Scripture would neuer haue ſayd, that, <hi>As they which minister about holy thinges, eate of thoſe thinges whicb are of the Temple, and they which waite at the Altar, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with the Altar: So the Lord hath ordained, that they which preach the Goſpell, ſhould liue of the Goſpell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That our Sauiour ordayned the Miniſtery of the Goſpell with no ornature of outward beauty, no magnificence of worldly ſtatelines, as he did of old the Moſaicall miniſtery: it was not to this end, that Chriſtians ſhould doe leſſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to theyr Paſtors, then did of old the Iſraelites; but for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8306:90"/> that the worthines thereof is ſuch, that it needeth no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ornaments: The which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding if it may haue, it is not magnified therin, if it may not haue, it is not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed therefore. But where the miniſtery of the Goſpell is receyued in a triumph (as it were) of publique authority, there al worldly goods ought to ſupply to the Honor of our Sauiour, and the health of his ſeruants: ſo that they may be denied where they are proffered, and requeſted where they they are denied; according as the cauſe, the time, the place, &amp; the people doe require. As for the ſeruants of Chriſt, they ought to be ready for all aſſayes: for honor and diſhonor, good report and euill report, plenty and pouerty, life and death, for that they are to vſe this world as not vſing it, the faſhion whereof paſſeth away.</p>
               <p>God vnder the old Teſtament framed to him ſelfe a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, the which although afterwards it might receiue diuerſe formes of gouernement, yet he did alwaies ſo prouide for the honour of the Prieſthood, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies retained that degree of dignity, which the Lord would haue them maintain among the people of God. God vnder the Goſpell, hath impropriated no peculiar people, neyther hath he planted any certaine forme of gouernment: He ſent vnto all nations preachers of the Goſpell, priuate men, without any warlike accutrements. Them he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not to alter any form of gouernment, leaſt they might ſeeme to be ſent, rather for the ſubuerſion, then for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of the Gentiles. And yet this hindereth not, but that they may take vppon them a greater ſtate, and better beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the worthines of theyr calling, where Religion it ſelf is aduaunced by publique authority, and in wiſedome is made the ground-work both of the lawes and the common wealth. In the old lawe, the Prieſts Honor was eſpecially ſet downe, what, how great, after what ſort, in what things it ſhould conſiſt. In the new Teſtament that limitation coulde not bee layd forth; becauſe it could not (would they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo faine) be like it ſelfe, or the ſame, among all people, in all places, at all times. But as good chriſtians doe take vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8306:91"/> them ſelues many other imitable examples out of the old Teſtament, and the law of nature, and the orders of nations, by the which they may the better be brought vnto a ciuill conformity, and a conformable ciuility of life: ſo likewiſe ought we to doe in this caſe.</p>
               <p>The minority &amp; vnder-reckoning of the miniſtery, is not ſo held in the iudgements of thoſe chriſtians that haue their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences acquainted with diuine cauſes, but in the ſight of carnall profeſſors, and the cenſure of the Churches enemies. All indifferent harts &amp; eies may ſee and conceiue, that how much greater Chriſt is then <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and the Goſpel more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then the law, ſo much more honorable is the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like miniſtery, then the Aaronicall Prieſthood; the which we are abundantly taught by the manifeſt arguments of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; we may very well learne by the manifold Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of our Sauiour Chriſt. Of old among the people of God it was, for good cauſe, held a great matter, for any man to be like vnto <hi>Moyſes,</hi> or <hi>Elias.</hi> For after the receite of the law, and his familiar conference with God in the mount, the face of <hi>Moyſes</hi> is ſayd to haue ben ſo radiant with paſſing all wonderous bright ſome rayes, that the eyes of the amaſed Iſraelites by no means might indure the Sun bright luſtre of his reſplendent countenaunce. After him was <hi>Elias</hi> no leſſe honored and renowmed, as well for his wonderfull acts, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued in the zeale of God his law, as alſo for his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous end, tranſlated aliue into the Paradiſe of Heauen. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, the Apoſtle in his latter to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians doth learnedly maintaine, that the Miniſtery of <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was of the letter, and of death, but the Miniſtery of the Goſpell, of the ſpirite and of life, and ſo much the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. As for the reſt, our Sauiour himſelfe preferreth <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt alone before all the Prophets, whom he affirmeth to be more then a Prophet, and yet he reſolueth, that the leaſt Miniſter of the Church is greater then hee. And therefore if Chriſt may be Iudge, the leaſt Miniſter of the loweſt degree in the Church, is more honorable &amp; to be honored more in his office, then are any, or al the Prieſts of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
               <p>As for the low titles the Lord gaue to his Miniſters, for bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8306:91"/> the glorious inſignes of honor, as of Lord, Father, and Doctor: I aunſwere, that it was not done, that the Miniſters ſhould be of leſſe honor among the people, then were of old the Prieſts &amp; Leuits, or that they ſhould be debaſed beneath all eſtates, &amp; be of no eſteem in a chriſtian common wealth, but rather that they might retain a lowly &amp; an humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in ſo lofty &amp; ſo honorable an eſtate. For vnleſſe the Lord in wiſdome ſhould temper &amp; keep vnder the ouer-weaning waiwardnes of mans nature, euen in his deareſt ſeruantes, Such is the excellency of the Eccleſiaſticall calling, that the conceit thereof might eaſely ouercharge light mindes with lofty thoughts, &amp; ſodenly ouerturne raſh heads into ruined eſtates. But as humility is taught them in their inglorious ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; ſo is their excellency taught vs by their magnificall ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. For are not theſe they which are called, the Salt of the earth, the Light of the world, Stars in the firmame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Angels, and Legats, Stewards &amp; diſpenſers of the myſteries of God, Miniſters of the ſpirit of life? what and how great is that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and power they haue receiued of the Lord, that they can binde and loſe in earth, what things are bound and loſed in Heauen; that they can remit and retaine ſins? that they can open and ſhut the higheſt Heauen? Can there be any thing giuen to men more Honorable in this mortality?</p>
               <p>As for the vſe of thoſe names, Doctor, Lord &amp; Father, we will ſpeake therof hereafter. Now, that I may determine this diſputation, of thoſe things we haue here ſet downe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>That chriſtian people are no leſſe deuoted to their Paſtors in al duty, then were of old the Iſraelites to their Priests and Leuits.</hi> And, <hi>Where chriſtian religion is publikely authoriſed, that there the ſame degree of honor is to be giuen to the Miniſters in the common welth, which was vſed to the Prieſts &amp; Prophets among the people of God.</hi> But if ſo be it ſo fall out, that among vngodly people &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious Magiſtrats, there be no reuerend regard had of this honor due to the Miniſter, that there the profeſſors be not offended therewith, ſeeing the worthines of ther Miniſtery is ſuch, as that no iniury of man can any waies diminiſh it. For it becommeth them to be at this point with themſelues,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8306:92"/> that if ſo be the honor due to their miniſtery be giuen them, they may reioyce in the religious godlines of the faithfull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God: but if it be denied them, they may not grieue thereat, as if them ſelues had loſt any thing. Neyther are they greatly to contend with the Magiſtrate for their right, eſpecially at any intempeſtiue ſeaſon: but they are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their cauſes vnto God, and with <hi>Paul</hi> to expect a more conuenient time to expoſtulate. In the mean while let them pray vnto God, that he would vouchſafe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better mindes that would be accounted for good chriſtians. The chief care of a faithfull Paſtor muſt be this, to gaine many ſoules vnto Chriſt, not much riches, or many honors: Firſt let them ſeek the kingdome of God, and al theſe things ſhalbe caſt vppon them. Wherefore, ſeeing there are many parts of that honor which is due to the Miniſter, I will chiefely proſecute thoſe, which the ciuil ſociety of life doth require in a chriſtian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and that aboue all others, which conſiſteth in the maintenance of Miniſters; a thing neuer ſo much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie as at this day. Of the which we will firſt heare what was the opinion of thoſe fathers which liued in time next after the Apoſtles.</p>

And as this is due &amp; decent ſo of the contrary part; I account it both vnmeete and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and vngodly alſo, that he which worſhippeth God, and entreth into the Church of God, and knoweth that the Prieſts and Miniſters do wait at the altar, and attend eyther vppon the word of God, or the

Among <hi>Baſil</hi> his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles there is one whole one, which teſtifieth, that there were manie at that time which vſed to leaue by teſtament a great part of their inheritance vnto the Church, and ſome ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times which did make free gift of all. But what neede I to ſtande vppon the manifolde reports of ſuch thinges? The lawes of the Emperours, concerning this whole matter, are ſufficiently knowne.

When all the Church goodes of euerie Dioceſſe were in common vnto all the Church-men of the ſame territorie, to bee diuided to euerie Church-man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſcretion of the Biſhop; then was that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in force: <hi>The goodes of the Church are the goodes of the poore:</hi> Not that the whole ſubſtance of the Church was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed vppon the poore, but becauſe the fourth part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was their due by right. For the firſt part was for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop himſelfe: the ſecond, for the other Church-men: the third, for the Church workes: the fourth, for releeuing the poore, and redeeming the captiue.</p>
               <p>But when as by reaſon of the manifolde inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which did dayly ariſe by meanes of this communitie, and the great multitude of Churches which now began to bee euerie where erected and ſet vp throughout the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and indowed with peculiar commodities, they began to depart from this communitie, by a ſecrete conſent (as it were) of the whole world, and ſo, that certain portions were deſigned for the Biſhops allowance; others alſo, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſts and Eccleſiaſticall perſons which were in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie reſidence in euery Cathedrall Church; and laſt of all

Al the which are commonly diſtinguiſhed into two ſeuerall kinds: whereof ſome are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Spirituall,</hi> and ſome accounted <hi>Temporall.</hi> But ſeeing theſe tearmes do neyther ſo fitly, nor yet ſo fully expreſſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8306:96"/> of theſe things, more proper words were to be deuiſed by more perfect Ciuilians. For vnto that which is <hi>Temporall,</hi> there is nothing in nature oppoſite, but that which is <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall:</hi> and to that which is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> nothing is contrary, but that which is <hi>Carnal</hi> or corporal. They therefore ſpeak more aptly of theſe thinges, who for the worde <hi>Temporall,</hi> vſe the words <hi>Ciuil</hi> and humane: and for <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the words <hi>Sacred</hi> holy, and diuine. Now albeit, that ought generally to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted holy &amp; ſacred, whatſoeuer is conſecrated to God, and his Miniſterie: yet notwithſtanding, they cal oblations (becauſe they more nearely concerne God and his ſeruice) more properly <hi>ſacred and diuine thinges;</hi> not ſo much for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſake, as for that the condition and proprietie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſuch. But <hi>humane and ciuil goods,</hi> they account the fields and poſſeſsions of the Church; for that in nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they are not vnlike vnto thoſe, which other Citizens poſſeſſe, and are therefore giuen vnto the Cleargie, that not onely in the Church, but alſo in the common-wealth, they may be of good eſtate, and wel able to maintaine the credit of the place and perſon they ſuſtaine: the which by no good meanes they can be able to vphold, if in worldly welth they be ſo curtold, and kept ſo thread-bare, as that they cannot be in caſe to be as bountifull as other men. Great matters are looked for at the hands of the Cleargie; as hoſpitalitie, releeuing the poore, and ſuch other thinges, which Chriſt himſelfe not onely taught, but in perſon performed in ſome good ſort. And is it not a ſhame for a Biſhop to exhort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto charitie towards the poore and needie, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe neither to put the ſame in practiſe, nor yet to be able?</p>
               <p>But leaſt any man ſhould thinke, that this diſtinction came out of the Popes Mint, and therefore to bee reiected; he ſhal vnderſtand by thoſe things we haue now cited, that it is the Fathers, the autentike Fathers. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>de tradendis baſilicis,</hi> maketh mention of the collations of the people, and the fields which the Church poſſeſſed.

Vnder this kinde we compriſe the paiment of tenthes and tythes alſo: albeit there bee great difference betwene thoſe tythes, which eyther now the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pay of their owne voluntarie, not conſtrained, or haue of olde religiouſly vndertaken by a lawe impoſed vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and their poſteritie, to pay vnto the Miniſters; &amp; thoſe tythes which Princes gaue vnto them, and laid out for them by their Iniunctions. For wee muſt vnderſtand thus much alſo, that tenthes haue beene paide of olde, not onely to the Prieſtes, but vnto the chiefe Magiſtrate alſo. Haue wee not heard of certaine tributes wont to bee paid to the common treaſurie, which afterwardes were giuen by the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> vnto the Churches? Namely, for that albeit the ſuperſtition of the Gentiles were in many places put down by publike authoritie; yet the Nobles and richer ſort, with the greater part of the people, hauing not forthwith recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the faith of Chriſt, the bare oblations of the faithfull, (althogh bountiful) were not ſufficing to relieue the poore, and to maintaine the ſtate of their Paſtors. So that vnleſſe I quite loſe mine ayme, thoſe tributes were eyther tenthes or tithes.</p>
               <p>For there is nothing better knowne, then that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes impoſed the paiments of tenthes, vpon thoſe prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they conquered: and what proportion could they more fitly giue vnto profeſſed Churches, then the tenthes of thoſe they conquered? This example did <hi>Charles</hi> the great follow, who hauing ouercome the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and hauing put to flight their King <hi>Windekind,</hi> hee commaunded tenthes to be paid vnto him: part whereof the Biſhops and other Paſtors of the Church had, and part the Kinges officers alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
               <p>As for the coniecture of <hi>Crantz</hi> in his <hi>Metropolis,</hi> who thinketh that tenthes were giuen vnto Nobles in fee, by the Biſhops, I cannot for my part allowe thereof: ſeeing it ſo euidently appeareth out of the approued Annalies, that thoſe tenthes were receyued of the Kinges Officers before
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:8306:97"/> there were any Biſhops, and whereas yet there were none. But whereas tythes ſeemed not to ſuffice the ſtate of the Cleargie, the godly Prince, of a religious and wiſe purpoſe, added glebes and landes vnto the vſe of the Church. For indeed that wilde Nation, tamed onely by force &amp; armes, receiued the Chriſtian Religion for feare, but in affection were ſo eſtraunged from it, that they would ſooner ſuffer the Biſhops, and thoſe preachers which the Emperour ſent vnto them, rather to ſterue among then, then to thriue by them.</p>
               <p>But who ſo deſireth to reade more of this matter, may reade <hi>Crantz</hi> his Metropolis, and the Saxon Chronicles. In the meane while, wee haue thus learned, that thoſe tenthes and tythes, which no religion of the Chriſtian people, but the liberalitie of the religious Magiſtrate hath giuen vnto the Church, were properly to bee accounted among the Churches, <hi>Ciuill goodes.</hi> But when as at this day they are ſo intermingled, that the manner of their firſt donations is not known, for good cauſe they are now called by the more certaine and the more ſingular part of them, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accounted among thoſe Church goods, which are not ciuill, but ſacred and diuine.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe goods of the Church which wee diſtinguiſh by the name of <hi>ciuill</hi> goods and <hi>humane,</hi> they may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into the poſſeſsion of ſuch fearms and rents, which the Church had euen vnder heathen Emperors before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine;</hi> and into the poſſeſſion of ſuch fees and mannors, which vnder the Chriſtian Magiſtrate haue annexed vnto them ſome ciuil iuriſdiction. The which, becauſe ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that no Eccleſiaſticall perſon ought to inioy, wee are in like manner to examine that matter, the rather, for that there are ſome which thinke, they ought rather to liue of other mens Almes.</p>

But the law of God defieth this errour, and forbiddeth the whole trade of begging among his people. Neither doe wee read, that the Lord at any time repealed this lawe; and ſure we are, that there haue beene alwayes extant among vs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lawes of the Emperours alſo againſt vpright beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>Almes are giuen for pittie ſake to helpe and cheare the needie: but whatſoeuer is giuen as a teſtimonie of any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is eyther a ſtipend for certaine paines taken, or a preſent for a certaine reuerence conceiued (albeit the party be poore vnto whom it is performed.) When the Lord therefore ſent forth his Diſciples to preach, hee gaue them a commiſsion to take vp their mainteinance of them to whome they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and hee therefore compared them to labourers, and their ſtipend to a reward, not to an almes; which being due, is to be charged, and diſcharged as of right. Whereby the nature of thoſe things which the godly did contribute vnto the Lord his vſe, and his Apoſtles, is eaſely vnderſtood to be of the condition, not of almes, but of fees. Euen as the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and certaine parts of the ſacrifices were alotted to the Prieſts, not as free almes, but as the fruites of their labours: ſo the godly Paſtors doe receiue of the faithfull people, not a doale, but a duetie; the one beeing of right, the other of meere pittie.

               <p>In the meane while, I will not ſticke with them for ſo much as this commeth to, that in ſuch a ſenſe, thoſe thinges which are giuen to the Church for the benefite of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, may bee called <hi>Almes</hi> alſo: this alwaies reſerued, that they ſtill differ white and blacke from thoſe almes, with the which the poore are releeued.

Neither doth any man doubt, that the faithfull are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by any religion, to become the free tenaunts of their Princes.</p>
               <p>But as for the lawes and conditions which perticularlie concerne the eſtate of Miniſters, there is not any one which inhibiteth them to vſe the benefite of Princes, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to them, as far as other Citizens. Ouer and beſides all this, the Euangelique precepts are in no caſe an excuſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right of nations, or the equity of <hi>Moſes</hi> law: but they all (and all the worlde ſhall witnes the ſame) haue appointed for the Prieſts and ſacred Miniſters, both fields and farmes and other ciuill eſtates. And can they by any law, or equity be ſequeſtred from the generall priuiledges of all cittizens, which are to liue now among citizens, and to ſuſtaine vnder the ſame Magiſtrate the ſame burdens of the commonwelth with other Cittizens?</p>
               <p>And hath not God himſelfe commaunded by his law, that there ſhould be giuen vnto the Prieſts and Leuites, not onely tythes and offerings, but Cities alſo, with their towns and teritories? Or had they any leſſe authority ouer theſe their townes and Citties, then had the other Tribes ouer their Citties and fields which fel vnto them by lot? The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell beeing receaued by publique authority, the Lord hath
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8306:99"/> no where forbidden the Miniſters of the Goſpell to poſſeſſe fields and farmes after the ſame manner, neither hath hee inhibited that anie ſuch realties ſhould bee giuen them to poſſeſſe. But is it poſsible there ſhould bee any ſo baſe, and bad minded towards religion, that he could once wiſh the Miniſters thereof to be of worſe eſtate in a chriſtian ſociety, then were of olde the Prieſtes and Leuites in the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſraell?</hi> It is well knowen, that Miniſters hauing to conuerſe in a ciuill ſocietie, had neede alſo of thoſe helpes which are requiſite in a ciuill ſociety, &amp; may reconcile them into fauor, and maintaine them in authority with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, as wiſedome and wealth eſpeciallie: Seeing that whoſoeuer hee bee that neglecteth either of theſe, can by no meanes liue, and liue well in a ciuill ſocietie.</p>
               <p>The wiſe man in his Eccleſiaſtes the ſeuenth chapter, hath verie well noted the practiſe of this: <hi>For wiſedome is good</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with an inheritaunce, and the excellencie of them which ſee the Sunne, becauſe that man ſhall rest in the ſhadowe of wiſedome, and the ſhadow of ſiluer:</hi> And indeed, vppon theſe two pillers doth reſt the chiefe ſtrength and ſtay of a ciuill life. There is one kind of life which is publique, and in the common proſpect of men, and hath neceſſarilie to doe with men of all ſortes: and there is an other kinde of priuate and priuie life, vnder an heathen Magiſtrate, full of danger; ſo that, there hee is to deale as wel with Magiſtrates as with priuate men: heere, he may well deale with none at all. I ſay in this caſe there is no compariſon to be made of theſe two kinds betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that without diſtinction wee ſhould make the like condition of the Miniſters life in all places, and ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like conditions.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the former obiections I firſt aunſwere, according to that I haue already proued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well by the lawes of the firſt chriſtians, as by the teſtimony of the ancient fathers, that the Church long before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his time had both fields and farmes, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and commodities pertaining to the ſame. But is there now any other reaſon, why Eccleſiaſticall perſons may not alſo hold the ſame in fee (if they be giuen in fee) as well as did of old theſe Prieſts and Leuits, thoſe Townes and Cittyes which they receiued of theyr brethren? As for thoſe Canons before cited, I aunſwere and affirme, that we allow, nor Elder nor Biſhop to be detained, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen with ſecular cares from theyr ſpiritual function any further, then may be beneficial to the Church and common wealth, or may ſatiſfie the neceſſity of our chriſtian neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

               <p>To the foureſcore and ſecond Canon, I aunſwer and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that ſeruice of war is forbidden by the ſame, not that which is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but that which is <hi>voluntary.</hi> Vppon which ground I hold this for a ſure principle, that that Prieſthood
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8306:101"/> or Biſhop doth both againſt the honor and the honeſty of the ſacred miniſtery, whoſoeuer without commaund of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme autority, or conſtraint of extreme neceſſity, ſhal take vppon him any ſeruice of war, eyther as leader or as ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But when ſuch time and places betide, as ſhall exact this at our handes, we are vnwillingly to yeeld to vnwelcome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his ſecond Booke the third chapter, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of one <hi>Iames</hi> Biſhop of the Citty of <hi>Niſib,</hi> (which of ſom is called Antioche Migdon) that he was vppon occaſion both Biſhop and <hi>Captaine</hi> of the ſame his Citty, the which by the helpe of God he manfully defended againſt <hi>Sapor</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and deliuered the ſame as well with his prowes, as his prayers. The ſame <hi>Theodoret,</hi> in his fourth booke the twelfth Chapter, recordeth as much and much more, of the warlike power and prowes of <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Samoſis,</hi> who mannaging himſelfe with all manner warlike abilements, ranged along throughout <hi>Syria, Phenicia,</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> wher he erected Prieſts and Deacons, and performed ſuch other Ecceſiaſticall penſions. Neyther did I euer read of any that found himſelfe offended with this action, or thought his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offended againſt that Canon. I doe not ſo thinke (nor will I ſay ſo much) of <hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Cyrillus</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who tooke vppon them a ſecular principality ouer that Citty, the Emperour not noting it, but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding it.</p>
               <p>As for the Canon which <hi>Cyprian</hi> citeth, I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that I cannot attayne vnto the reaſon thereof, onely this I am aſſured of, that it was but a particular and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall decree, ſeruing onely for that time and that place. For no doubt, to take charge of Widowes and Orphanes, is an eſpeciall worke of piety, and commaunded of God in euery place of his Lawe: and ſo, that they incurre no ſmall blame, that deferre to take vppon them not the patrimony, but the patrociny of ſuch.</p>
               <p>For good cauſe therefore was the old cuſtome continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Chuch, that Biſhops ſhould be the patrons of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:8306:101"/> and the Fathers of Orphanes, and that they eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially before all others, were to take charge of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſhame to theyr calling, without any breach of the Canons. You ſhall heare how the Councell of <hi>Sardis</hi> doth allowe and recommend the ſame in plaine wordes. For this is the ſpeeche which <hi>Oſiris,</hi> then Biſhop there, made. Much importunity and too much confluence, with vnlawful ſutes, hath brought the matter to this paſſe, that we haue not ſo much either fauor, or credit committed vnto vs; whiles there are ſome, which ceaſe not to repayr to the Court of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, (and eſpecially they of <hi>Africa</hi>) who (as we know) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and contemn the wholeſome directions of our moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brother and fellow Biſhop <hi>Gratus.</hi> Who do not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diuers and ſundry matters not materiall to the Church, (as many times it commeth to paſſe) that widows, orphans, and the poore might be ſuccoured, but they doe further craue for certaine ſecular dignities, and ciuill offices. This bad order therefore ſtirreth vp not onely much muttering, but many offences alſo. Notwithſtanding, this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable thing, that Biſhops ſhould be a meanes for thoſe which are oppreſſed with wrongfull violence, (as if ſo bee a widow be moleſted or an orphan defrauded) and yet ſo, that theſe parties haue ſome iuſt cauſe of complaint, and ſome honeſt petition to praeſent. Wherefore, if it ſo pleaſe you (my beloued brethren) let this be a decree, that Biſhops come not to the Court, except happely they, whom the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Emperour ſhall by his letters inuite. But becauſe oft times it commeth to paſſe, that they which ſuffer wrong, flye to the Church for ſuccour, and they alſo which doe wrong, and are adiudged therefore to ſome ile, or exile, or in deede what ſentence of iudgement ſoeuer they receiue, they ought here to be relieued, and without al doubt their pardon to be craued: Therefore if it ſo pleaſe you, as I haue ſayd, ſo let it bee decreed. They all gaue a <hi>placet,</hi> and let it be enacted. This Canon containeth a certaine expoſition of the ſixt Canon of the Apoſtles, and it teacheth vs what ſecular cares a Biſhop, or a Prieſt may vndertake, and what not. The
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8306:102"/> Biſhops in this point were imitators of their Fathers the Prophets, which alwayes gaue their helping hand to wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, orphanes, and other afflicted people.

                  <hi>VVhat wouldeſt thou that I ſhould doe for thee? is there any thing to he ſpoken for you to the King, or to the Captaine of the hoſt?</hi> Nor neede this ſeem to any man any ſuch a ſtrange duety of religion, that Biſhops (or other Miniſters) ſhould repaire to Princes, to intreate for the diſtreſſed.</p>

               <p>But a <hi>Fee</hi> is defined among the Lawyers diuers waies: Firſt, that it is a military ſeruice impoſed and vndertaken vppon this condition, that the tenant for the benefite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued performe his ſeruice in warre, and therein ſhewe his fealty and fidelity to his patrone and his benefactor. (By which we may vnderſtand, what was the original of tenures in <hi>Fee.</hi>) Notwihſtanding, for as much as there are ſome fees which are not military, neyther ſtand vppon knights ſeruice, this may ſerue for a more generall definition, that, a <hi>Fee</hi> is a benefite, or a priuiledge giuen vnto ſome man vppon this condition, that he which receyueth the benefite, ſhall in lieu thereof performe ſome duty or ſeruice, as a teſtimony of his thankefulnes. But here there are three things of neceſſity to be obſerued: the <hi>Perſons,</hi> the <hi>Things,</hi> and the <hi>Right.</hi> The <hi>Perſons</hi> are the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Vaſall</hi> (that I may ſo ſpeake with the Feudiſt) betweene whom the ſeruice is contracted: The which for the moſt part in deede is military or knights
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8306:103"/> ſeruice; I ſay, for the moſt part, becauſe of the Eccleſiaſtike or church ſeruice. But the <hi>Thing</hi> is the matter &amp; ſubſtance of the benefite receiued, as fields, fermes, iuriſdictions, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, courts, or whatſoeuer elſe is held in <hi>Fee.</hi> But laſt of all, the <hi>Right</hi> accrueth from theſe both: For the <hi>Fee</hi> in reſpect of the Lord, is a benefite giuen to the <hi>Vaſall,</hi> vpon that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he ſhould recogniſe the autor therof in ſome kind of ſeruice; but in reſpect of the <hi>Vaſall,</hi> the <hi>Fee</hi> is the right of vſing and manuring another mans thing, vpon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that ſome ſeruice of duety, and teſtimony of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty be due for the ſayd thing. But now is there any of theſe three, more croſſe of contrary to the calling and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Miniſters, then of other Chriſtians?

It ſufficeth for this time, that we haue noted, howe all <hi>Fees</hi> are not giuen for military
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:8306:103"/> dueties, neyther doe all hold vppon <hi>Knights</hi> ſeruice. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer this alſo is moſt manifeſt, that the lawes of <hi>Fees</hi> haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times altered, and the nature with the lawes, ſo that ther is nothing more variable then that title: And, that the whole matter dependeth vppon certaine cuſtomes, and the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pleaſures of the <hi>Lords,</hi> who vppon any condition, or without any condition (if it pleaſe them) may freely giue the things they haue, to be held and vſed.</p>
               <p>In deed the firſt occaſion of <hi>Fees</hi> was <hi>Knights ſeruice:</hi> that the Prince might alwayes haue a ſufficient hoſt, &amp; Captains competent for the defence of the common wealth: So that <hi>Fees</hi> no doubt in the beginning were no other thing, but ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds for war, not hereditary but temporary, &amp; not vnlike to Princes annual penſions at this day.

In the meane while, thoſe Lawes which ſerue to reſtrain cleargy men from theſe Fees, do in like manner by the ſame reaſon exclude women and children, and young men, and old men, and all men that are not fit for military ſeruice: Who when as at this day they are notwithſtanding admitted; what reaſon, that Clergy men alone, ſhould be excepted?

But as of old for good cauſe it ſeemed neceſſary to them which had the chiefe place in the common wealth, to giue lands and Lordſhips in <hi>Fee</hi> to their Nobles and noble war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours for military attendance, and the peaceable continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the common wealth: ſo alſo did they take it no leſſe neceſſary, and as great reaſon for them to giue vnto Paſtors and Biſhops in the like name and nature of <hi>Fees</hi> both towns and towres, and parkes, &amp; woods, and pooles, and fiſhings, and fermes, and fields, and tenths, and tithes, for the ſacred miniſtery of Gods Church, and the reuerend adminiſtration of things ſacred, thereby to aduance the honor, and ſupport the worthines of that moſt honorable &amp; heauenly calling.</p>

               <p>And furthermore, for that the Lord himſelfe beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to ſit but as arbiter betweene two brethren, deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame. And againe, when the Apoſtles made the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which of them ſhould bee the greateſt, hee made aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere and ſayd: <hi>The Kings of the Gentils raigne ouer them, and they which beare rule ouer them are called gracious Lordes: but yee ſhall not be ſo, but he that is greatest amongſt you, let him be as the leaſt, and he which is Prince, as he which miniſtreth.</hi> By which, the wordes and examples of our Sauiour wee are taught, that the Miniſtery of the Goſpell hath nothing common with the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>It may ſuffice for an anſwere vnto this obiection, which wee haue before noted: namely, that all this they talke of, hath his place in that eſtate, in the which, our Sauiour and his Apoſtles liued, not in that common-wealth, in the which the chiefe Magiſtrates acknowledge Chriſt Ieſus their chiefe Lord, and ſoueraigne King. For as the Magiſtrate is of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calling now in the Church, then before he had: ſo is it reaſon, alſo that the ſeruaunts of the Lorde ſhould bee of better eſtate in the Common-wealth, then before they were.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate, which before was an enemie and a perſecutour: (according vnto the propheſie of <hi>Eſaias</hi>) is become a Foſter-father of the Church, and a religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of the Lorde Chriſt: vnder whome, were it not an abſurd thing, that the ſeruaunts of Chriſt ſhould haue no more honour, then vnder a perſecutor? But becauſe it is not ſet downe expreſlie in the Scripture, what, of what ſort, and how great the ſame ought to bee, many mens mindes are
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:8306:105"/> heere at a maze, and ſome are of mind ſo to leaue it, as at a dead loſſe; and yet notwitſtanding, the thing it ſelfe is not ſo hard to find out, and it is in his owne nature wel enough knowen, and that both by the written lawe of God, and the vniuerſall cenſure of all nations: were it not for the awke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde interpretation of thoſe ſcriptures which I haue nowe cited.</p>
               <p>Out of the which notwithſtanding, there is nothing els di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectie concluded, but that it is not any part of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall function, to intermedle in ciuil affaires, the which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is out of all controuerſie. Neither is that the queſtion: but whether the ſame man that is a Paſtor, may not togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the miniſtery of the Goſpell, bee lawfully imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in politique affaires, for the benefite of the Church, and good of the Common-wealth. For when as the Miniſter of the church, is cittizen alſo of the common-wealth, he ought not thinke any thing not pertaining to him, that pertaineth to the Common-wealth: ſo that beeing lawfully called, hee may not vndertake ſome part of the ciuill eſtate. As for that which I lately cited concerning our Sauiour, who refuſed to be an arbiter, it is nothing to this queſtion. For the ſpirite of Chriſt in the mouth of <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly teach vs, that the meaneſt of the church, are good enough to iudge of earthlie cauſes, for that one day they ſhall iudge the worlde, yea, the Angels themſelues; (a iudgement farre greater then this.) The which, ſeeing the Apoſtle affirmeth of any Chriſtian: is it to bee thought, that onely Chriſt alone was no fit man to take vp a ſmall matter betweene two brethren, if they both had bene content to ſtand vnto his iudgement? Wee cannot therefore imagine, that our Sauiour Chriſt ſimplye refuſed the office of an arbiter, but that hee denied himſelfe to bee that iudge, which might command both parties to ſtand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his arbiterment.</p>
               <p>And is not this then a ſlight teſtimonie, for to proue it not lawfull for a Biſhop, (who is both a Cittizen, and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect) to exerciſe anye ciuill iuriſdiction, the Magiſtrate ſo commaunding him? or to execute ſome other penſion of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8306:105"/> the Common-wealth, (not abhorring altogeather from his profeſſion) beeing furniſhed with ſufficient authority to diſcharge it?</p>
               <p>That the foure-ſcore and ſecond Canon commandeth him to be diſordered, who vndertaketh both Prouinces (the Eccleſiaſticall power, and the ſecular principality,) for my part, I ſay not againſt it: if ſo be that it bring no inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the Biſhoppes of the Church, and that it may bee done with the good leaue of the Prince, and without anie great hurt to the Church and Common wealth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we are alſo bolde to ſay, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Cyrill,</hi> By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> tranſgreſſed that Canon: of whome <hi>Socrates</hi> reporteth, that of themſelues they tooke vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the principality of that citty. In like manner doe the Biſhops of Rome, when as they improoue vnto themſelues thoſe things which are <hi>Caeſars.</hi> For when as they are the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and ſubiectes of the Emperour, they haue notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding extolled themſelues aboue their Lords, and aduanced the ſheepheardes croyſier aboue the royall ſcepter. But for thoſe Biſhops which vaile their bonnet to their Soueraigne, and obey their Princes in honeſt and godly things, there is not the like reaſon. And many things many times are done in the Common-wealth extraordinarilye, ſo that there can no lawe bee publiſhed or made, which it is not lawfull for to gain-ſay at ſome time or other, for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
               <p>Neither is the other example that they vrge, of anye force. For had our Sauiour meant to haue inthronized himſelfe in that earthly kingdome, (which he neuer ment) yet would hee haue refuſed that tumultuous courſe: For what power had that part of the people to annoint him King?</p>

Neither are they therein to be ſo cenſured, as if they vſurped the place of the ciuill Magiſtrate: for he did it by the conſent of the chiefe Magiſtrate: as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the writings of <hi>Iustinian</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>de Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pali audientia,</hi> the fourth title, where hee commaundeth, that there ſhould be that reuerence giuen vnto their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is due vnto the hieſt powers: (from whome it is not lawfull to appeale) and more-ouer he commandeth that the execution of their iudgements, be done by his ciuil iudges.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of the ſtatute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> (as they call it) (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the which, whoſoeuer offend, they are puniſhed with is a matter of verie great daunger in England, for Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to inuade the office of the ciuill Magiſtrates: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there is kept a moſt circumſpeact diſtinction betweene the affaires of the Ciuil, and the Eccleſiaſtical Court. If at anie time anie of the Biſhops (or anie other of the cleargie) are thought meet men to vndertake any ciuill charge, they doe it not by the eſpeciall commaundement and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:8306:106"/> of the King, vnder the broad ſeale of England. But thoſe charges are alwayes accompanied with ſome honour, ſo that they may be accounted rather a help, then a hurt to the proceedings of the Goſpell: (as are the offices and dignities of a priuie Counſeller, a Commiſſioner, a Iuſtice of peace, and ſuch like.) Neither (as I doe thinke) will any man of ſound iudgement ſay, that thoſe charges are eyther impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon any Cittizen without the chiefe Magiſtrate, or if they be ſo impoſed, that they can of any man be depoſed, or laide aſide.</p>
               <p>If any man except, that this is more abhorring from the office of a Biſhop, then was of olde the charge of the poore, from the which notwithſtanding the Apoſtles did abdicate themſelues, becauſe they could not attend vppon that, and their owne charge too: and therfore vrge, that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for Biſhops, that they ſhould diſcharge both charges well; for which cauſe they ought to ſequeſter themſelues from the one: I anſwer, firſt, that the Apoſtles did not ſo far foorth diſcharge themſelues of the poore mans boxe, that that they thought it not appertaining to them to haue any further care thereof: for they alwayes continued patrons of the poore, as doe the Biſhops alſo, whom we will not ſo intangle with ciuill cauſes, that they forſake their owne; but that, (as it eſpecially concerneth their office) vpright dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſincere charitie may bee maintained among them, whoſe ſoules health is committed vnto them. But how much a godly and diligent Biſhop may doe in this matter, <hi>Austine</hi> alone may ſerue for many examples, who wrote ſo many excellent volumes, when as yet he imployed no ſmall part of his time in theſe troubleſome affaires. Whoſe words I will heere infer, for that they inforce a ſufficient confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this their cauill: <hi>I call the Lord Ieſus witneſſe to my ſoule</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>in whoſe name I boldly ſpeake theſe thinges, that for ſo much as concerneth my commoditie, I had rather worke euerie day with my hand (as it is vſed in wel ordered Monasteries) and reſerue the other houres free to read, and to pray, and to exerciſe my ſelfe in the Scriptures, then to ſustaine the tumultuous perplexities of other
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8306:107"/> cauſes, in determining ſecular controuerſies by iudgement, or in taking them vp by arbitrement. To the which troubles the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle hath appointed vs, not of his owne will, but of his that ſpake in him. The which notwithstanding we read not that he himſelfe ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for indeed the courſe of his Apostleſhip ſtood not with it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he ſay,</hi> If therefore you haue any ſecular controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, bring them before vs, or appoint vs to giue iudgement of them, but thoſe which are leaſt eſteemed in the Church, ſet them vp <hi>(ſaith he.)</hi> And I ſpeak to your ſhame, is it ſo, that there is not any wiſeman among you, which can iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his brother, but the brother goeth to lawe with the brother, &amp; that before infidels? <hi>Wherfore, thoſe wiſe men which were reſiant in ſome certaine place, beeing faithfull and godly (not thoſe which diſcourſed this way and that way for the Goſpel ſake) I ſay, ſuch would hee haue to bee the examiners of thoſe matters. For which cauſe it is no where written of him, that he at any time atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon any ſuch buſines, from the which notwithſtanding we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee excuſed, albeit wee bee of the number of thoſe which are</hi> leaſt eſteemed, <hi>becauſe he would haue thoſe alſo ſet vp (if wiſe men were wanting) rather then that the controuerſies ſhould bee brought into the open and ordinarie Court. The which labour notwithstanding we vndertake, not without comfort in the Lorde, for the hope of eternall life, that we may bring forth fruit with patience.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine;</hi> whoſe reaſons in my iudgement may ſatisfie any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man, verely they ſatisfie mee, neither can I finde anie thing to miſlike in this action of his.</p>
               <p>This is one generall maxime in the rules of Chriſtianity, That whatſoeuer wee reade in the word of God, eyther for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, beeing not euill of his owne nature; or commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, beeing of it ſelfe not good; in thoſe thinges Chriſtian charitie diſpenſeth, and diſpoſeth of the matter, as the time, the place, and the cauſe doth require. Vnto the which, whoſoeuer doth refuſe to ſubſcribe, he doth it of ſtubborne and froward hypocriſie, not of any religion or deuotion he hath of the precept.</p>
               <p>Neyther is the Diuines rule vnknown, concerning thoſe things which are bidden, or forbidden in the word of God;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8306:107"/> namely, That ſome thinges are forbidden, becauſe they are euill; and ſome thinges are euill, becauſe they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, (ſuppoſe for ſome eſpeciall purpoſe.) And againe on the contrary part, That there are ſome things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe they are good; and ſome thinges therefore to bee accounted good, becauſe they are commaunded by God, who requireth ſuch thinges of men for ſome eſpeciall cauſes.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe things which are of the firſt ſort and ſection, are vnder a conſtant and perpetual law, and not to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by any means: but there is not the like condition of the other ſort, neither do they bind anie man any further, then the reaſon and occaſion of the law doth require. Examples of this matter wee haue in the obſeruation of the Sabaoth, and the vſe of the Shew-bread, of the which it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any man to eate, but the Prieſts onely: beſides many other things of like nature, which we read to be either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, or condemned. In this our caſe; it is no crime to be a King, nor to be a Magiſtrate, a capitall ſinne. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reaſon of the commandement abating the thing it ſelfe abideth free; and it remaineth lawfull for Princes, and other Magiſtrates, to be of power to command the Biſhops of the Church in a Chriſtian common-wealth, thoſe things, which would rather be an aide and an ornament, then any hurt or impediment to their holy calling: I ſpeake of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in generall, not of any one mans calling (which haplie may be hindred, and ſhall haue neede of others which may helpe him) but of all theirs, which are in the ſame calling, vnto whome there ariſeth any honour and authoritie from the reſt. So that if all things be throughly examined, and all commodities with all diſcommodities compared together, which may any waies accrue vnto the Church and common wealth: I doubt not, but that which wanteth in one parte, ſhall be requited in the other with aduauntage.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I come to that place of <hi>Luke,</hi> the two and twentith chapter: where it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that there was ſome queſtion made amongſt the Apoſtles, which of them ſhould ſeeme the greater: the which for that it aroſe of a certaine perſwaſion of honor and rule, our Lord &amp; Sauiour (the great Maiſter of humility) repreſſed the ſame, and confuted their miſconceite, when as hee forbad them to imitate the proceedings of heathen Princes, and made himſelfe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his manner of gouernment. For albeit he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them indeed to a ſingular kind of dignitie, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he would haue them vnderſtand that the ſame differed heauen and earth, from that which is vſuall in imperiall kingdomes. For as the kingdome of God is diuers from the kingdomes of the earth, euen ſo it becommeth the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that his kingdome, to be of diuers conditions alſo.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is the faſhion of the Court, to ſewe pillowes vnder the elbowes euen of moſt vile men: and commonly they which grind the faces of the people with bloud-thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie tyrannie, and practiſe vpon them all kind of crueltie, are notwithſtanding called moſt mercifull and moſt gratious Lords. Wherefore our Sauiour eſpecially here taxed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt miſdemeanors of them, which then did domineer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the people of God, noting withall the manifold abuſes of other vngratious Tyrants, which by force and armes had inthralled mightie kingdomes vnder their dominion, vnto whome the grace of <hi>Gratiouſnes</hi> was giuen euen by them, whom they oppreſſed moſt vngratiouſly.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, there was ſetled in the mindes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles a certain conceit, that the kingdom of the Lord ſhould
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8306:108"/> be earthly, as they did ſee that of the <hi>Romanes</hi> to bee, and as they had heard that of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> to haue beene. Higher then this could not they aduance their conceits: for alâs they were as yet but meere infants in Chriſt, and did but learne as then to goe by ground. Whereuppon it came to paſſe, that they imagined very ſtrongly, that they could be made no other by the Lord, then Lords Lieutenantes at the leaſt: from the which their childiſh ouer-weening, our Sauiour doth in this place take them downe a little. But that it may be made yet more apparant vnto all, what might bee the Lord his very meaning in that his ſaying, I wil yet ſound into the cauſe a little deeper.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles ſeeme to make a verie plaine queſtion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding no more but this; <hi>Who ſhould be the greatest among them:</hi> but in what things he ſhould be the <hi>greatest,</hi> that is not there expreſſed. No doubt a man may be accounted <hi>greateſt</hi> for ſundry cauſes: as greateſt in age, in experience greateſt, greateſt in learning, in eloquence greateſt, greateſt in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in wealth, in nobilitie of birth, in authoritie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and ſuch like. But now, the Apoſtles were priuate men, in nothing ſingular, which commonly maketh mens minds ambitious, and cauſeth mens thoughtes to ouer-reach. As for age, experience, wealth, wiſedome, nobility, &amp; ſuch like, they openly bewray themſelues in whom ſoeuer they are the <hi>greatest,</hi> ſo that there is ſeldom any queſtion about thoſe things.</p>
               <p>It remaineth therefore, that the queſtion betwene them was for <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>authoritie:</hi> the which alſo may ſeeme a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous thing among the poore fraternitie of the twelue Apoſtles, vnleſſe haplie a man would iudge them ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, rather for their deſire, then for their honour. But farre be it from mee, that I ſhould raſhly condemne thoſe good men of any ſacrilegious ambition, ſeeing the Lord himſelfe did not ſo much correct them, as direct them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. It appeareth rather by that the Lord anſwered, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by any thing the Apoſtles propounded, that they did not regard the preſent ſtate of thinges, as they were then, but
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:8306:109"/> that they had an eye to that rather which they hoped to ſee ſhortly vnder Chriſt. They knewe, that the kingdome of GOD was now at hande, about the proclaiming where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they chiefly were ſent; neyther were they ignorant how honorably the Prophets had written thereof; namely, that it ſhould be, as a moſt mightie, ſo a moſt ample kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to bee bordered, but with the compaſſe of the whole earth; that all nations ſhould come and acknowledge their fealtie, and doe due homage thereunto: and that, albeit they expected many enemies and aduerſaries, both tyrants and traytors, yet notwithſtanding, the rebellious of the people ſhould be appeaſed at the laſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when as they were of beleefe, that this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhould be reſtored vnto Iſraell out of hand, their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, who ſhould be next vnto Chriſt in that kingdome. For as the Iſraelites had borne a long time the heauie yoke of ſome tyrannous Empires; ſo they were perſwaded, that all Nations ſhould nowe yeelde to the iuſt conſequence of their renued title. And they did ſee indeed, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent number did well agree with the twelue Princes of the twelue Tribes of Iſrael, and that the ſeuentie two Diſciples did as well reſemble the graund Senate of Gods people. Whereby as they knewe, that amongſt them of olde, there were diuerſe degrees of dignitie vnder King <hi>Dauid,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, ſo they perſwaded themſelues, that the like diſtinction of orders and honours ought to bee continued amongſt them. Neither could they ſo ſoone forget that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſpeach of their Lord, when he promiſed them, that one day they ſhould ſit vpon twelue thrones, and iudge the twelue tribes of Iſraell.</p>
               <p>Theſe conceites (I ſhould conceiue) the Apoſtles had then in their heades, being made as yet, and not throughly exerciſed in the cenſure of heauenly things: &amp; theſe I think rather to haue proceeded in them, of a certaine weake ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and erroneous miſconceiuing, then of any ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious pride, or ambitious ouer-weening.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8306:109"/> them, That he had not called them to ſway an earthly ſcepter, but to ſeeke a ſpirituall Empire: in the which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the power they ſhould receiue of him, they ſhould ſtill continue, and content themſelues, not Princes, but priuate men. Wherfore, albeit they ſhould be the chiefe and principall of the new people of God, yet their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie ſhould not bee any thing more magnificent then the eſtate of other priuate men, and therefore in the forme of that gouernment he had appointed for his Church, the firſt and principall ought to imitate his example, who liued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them as a ſeruant and a Miniſter, when as yet they called him (as indeede hee was) both Lord and Maiſter. And this is the plaineſt expoſition of Chriſt his words.</p>
               <p>Where we ſee, that our Sauiour, becauſe hee would not ſtirre vp any headſtrong innouation in the common welths and kingdomes vnto whom he ſent his Apoſtles, of eſpecial purpoſe he ſent them priuate and impotent, without either warlike complement, or ciuil regiment; namely, to conuert ſoules, not to inuert ſtates: leaſt if hee ſhould haue erected heere any earthlie kingdome, they might haue ſuppoſed, that there had beene no other kingdome to bee expected. No doubt the calling and ſtate of the Apoſtolike function was for iuſt cauſe great and honourable, and their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the ſpirituall kingdome autentike and inpregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and yet all that did not aduaunce them aboue the ſtate of priuate men in the common-wealth; and being priuate, hee would not haue them preſident therein. And verely theſe thinges were thus ordained of GOD, in a verie pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent manner, and vppon a verie eſpeciall purpoſe. For why ſhould anie occaſion bee giuen for the heathen to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill at the doctrine of the Goſpell, as a thing ſeditious to the gouernement, and pernitious to the common-wealth? The Lord without doubt did in great wiſedome foreſee, that the wicked would bee ready to picke many quarrels at the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell; when as notwithſtanding all this, there is no politike Philoſophie, no imperiall conſtitution, that doth more ſtrictly binde the conſciences of men vnto
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8306:110"/> ſubiection and obedience, then the doctrine of the Goſpell doth. The principles of Philoſophie, and the lawes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe permit many thinges againſt Tyrants, which the Religion of Chriſt doth flatly inhibite.</p>
               <p>But the prudent aduiſe of this precept of Chriſt wil more manifeſtly appeare, if wee ſhall for a time but imagine the contrarie: namely, that the Apoſtles had followed that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in the which they were found: and then let vs admit, that the whole worlde had beene wonne and waſted by them with warre and robberie: (for they muſt of force haue followed that forcible courſe, which that renowmed theefe <hi>Mahomet</hi> kept: a courſe farre differing from the means and manners of our Sauiour Chriſt.) But ſhould not thus the Iewes haue bene confirmed in their errour? And ſhould not by theſe meanes iuſt cauſe haue beene giuen to the Kings of the earth, to haue armed themſelues againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel? After the ſubuerſion of Hieruſalem, there was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent inquiſition made by the eſpeciall commandement of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> if anie could bee found that were of the ſtocke of <hi>Dauid.</hi> For the Iewes, notwithſtanding their ouerthrowe, gaue not ouer their hope, ſtill expecting their <hi>Meſsias:</hi> They did ſee that the times which <hi>Dauid</hi> had foretold, were then fulfilled; and thereupon they did argue, that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was borne, and that the time was now at hande, in the which the Romane Empire ſhould impaire, and themſelues pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: The which thing gaue the occaſion, that ſo great and cruell a perſecution was afterwardes rayſed againſt the ſame Nation.</p>
               <p>The like we reade of <hi>Domitian,</hi> who had the poſteritie of <hi>Dauid</hi> in no ſmall iealouſie. For caſting the worſt, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt ſome new <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould ariſe, and break the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Romane Empire, he cauſed inquirie to be made after all that were of that kindred. Wherupon one <hi>Iocatus</hi> by name, brought before him the nephews of <hi>Iudas</hi> (who was the Lord his brother according to the fleſh) who did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw their pedegree from <hi>Dauid,</hi> but were thought to be very nearely allyed to the Lord himſelf. But when they were
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8306:110"/> examined, what poſſeſſions they had, and of what wealth they were, &amp; were found to be of very mean eſtate, (the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their skinnes warranting the labour of their hands,) and when they further vnderſtood howe they beleeued, that the kingdome of Chriſt ſhould not bee an earthly Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, but an heauenly Hierarchie; neither yet, that he ſhould come before the conſummation of the worlde, to iudge the quicke and the dead: They were foorth-with reiected baſe and ſimple men, and were without ſuſpicion ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>In like maner (no queſtion) the priuate eſtate of the firſt Apoſtles, was both a teſtimonie vnto them of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and a ſafe conduct among the nations for their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But what would not the Romaine <hi>Caeſars</hi> and other like Magiſtrates haue doone, if the Miniſters of the Goſpell had bene ſent and ſet forth with power of warre, and other abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of like power?</p>
               <p>Theſe the precepts of our Sauiour, may therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely be alledged againſt the tyrannique Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> who chalengeth the right of all Empires, and holdeth the Romaine Empire, as his proper fee: but they cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt thoſe Biſhops, which liue ſubiect vnto lawes and Magiſtrates, and keepe themſelues in a proportionable order with other Cittizens. Wherefore, where the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt is honorablie receaued by publique authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how ſhould this abatement of our Sauiour be wreſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Biſhops? that they ſhould not be in that reuerend account vnder a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, which the lawes of all nations, and euen the very lawe of nature it ſelfe, and the written lawe of God alſo doth expreſly award them? As for thoſe places of ſcripture, about the which we now contend, this only may be gathered: That the Paſtors of churches, in reſpect of their miniſterie, haue no power ouer the bodies, or goods of Chriſtians; Neither that they can chalenge vnto themſelues thoſe rights, which God hath placed in the power of the Magiſtrate onely. But that the ſame Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in no place, at no time, for no cauſe, may commit no
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8306:111"/> portion of the Common-wealth vnto the Biſhoppes of the Church, it is not as yet prooued, neither can be, (if I bee not deceiued.)</p>

Are not the parts of of a Lawyer diuerſe, and the partes of a Phyſicion diuerſe? yet the ſame party may play both partes, and prooue as good a Lawyer as a Phyſicion. In like manner, the ſame man may be both Phyſicion and Diuine, and cure the body, as a leach, and comfort the ſoule, as a ſpirituall Father. <hi>Spiridion</hi> was a husband man, and got his liuing by graizing: yet was hee a Biſhop of the Church, and a Paſtor of ſoules; ſhall we thinke that he confounded both theſe functions? I, but a Biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the whole man, neither yet is one man ſufficing for more charges. I, but this indefinite cenſure is vncertainelie true, and certainely falſe: and there are manye preſidentes to the contrary, both in the old Teſtament, and in other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique hiſtories.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:8306:112"/>
               <p>Firſt, I would know whether <hi>Spiridion</hi> both Paſtor of ſheepe and of ſouls, were not a man able for both theſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? No man as yet (ſo far as I can learne) hath enuied him his ferme with his Biſhoprick: No man hath dared to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne that holy men, but all men haue worthely admired both his ſimplicity and his ſanctimony: and yet might hee haue beene more greedy of graizing, then of gaining ſoules, had his mynde ben ſet vppon coueteouſnes. But why then might not the ſame man haue beene both Biſhop, and the kings Counſeller as well? No doubt the greatnes of euerye charge is chiefely to be conſidered, and then alſo, the ſupply of neceſſary ayde, which a man may haue in either charge, whereby he may well diſcharge the ſame. There are ſome Churches more great then other ſom; &amp; ſom haue more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, ſome leſſe, in ſo much that the Paſtor may haue much time ſometime, to ſpare from his ordinary charge. And in a great Church, where the Biſhop hath many and great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, it may be, he hath many and great helps. Had theſe two functions beene ſo aduerſe and contrary the one to the other, that they could neuer be exerciſed together by the ſame man, <hi>Moyſes</hi> would neuer haue beene both <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Prieſt</hi> ouer the people of God.</p>
               <p>But I feare me, ſome ſilly ſhrewd fellow wil haue his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt me, for that I haue called <hi>Moyſes</hi> a Prieſt: And yet I would haue him firſt to vnderſtand, that after he had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Aaron,</hi> himſelfe ſtil continued both Prophet and Paſtor, as he was before. But that <hi>Ely</hi> &amp; <hi>Samuel</hi> were both <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> together, it cannot be denied. You will ſay, that was a thing <hi>extraordinary:</hi> and I ſay, that I do not ſpeak of any <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> thing, neyther of all the Paſtors of the Church: onely I vrge what may lawfully be done, where the welfare of the Church or common wealth requireth the ſame, and in the meane while, theſe examples ſhal proue, that the ſame thing hath beene done.</p>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8306:115"/> Theſe conſult that the common wealth ſuſtaine no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in corne and cattell, in wares and marchaundiſe, leaſt themſelues at any time ſhould want their ſweet return: They doe not a little regard theſe things: but beſides theſe, theyr eſpecial care is that iuſtice, faith, godlines, and true religion decay not in the common wealth, leaſt at any time the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt ſhould want his due increaſe. But do learned BB. vnderſtand leſſe what belongeth to the good of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, then illiterat Burgreeues, &amp; rank chapmen? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnprofitably haue they conſumed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their head-paine vigils, and heart breaking ſtudies, if they haue learned nothing whereby they may benefite the common wealth.</p>
               <p>I, but Miniſters are of priuate eſtate, Burgreeues are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates: It is not conuenient that the ſame man ſhould vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake both an Eccleſiaſtique, and a politique office.</p>
               <p>Truth it is, neyther doe I knowe any ignoraunt (except them ſelues) what is decent in this matter, and what is not. But to be preſent at the ſacred Parliaments, to giue a voyce, and to giue aduice, is not to be a Magiſtrate. The books of the Prophets are plentifull in the precepts of peace, in the policies of war, and in the beſt counſels for al things which concerne the common wealth: and ſacred hiſtories doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of purpoſe, how the people of God neuer aduentured vppon any action of weight and moment, before they had well conſulted with the Prieſts and the Prophets. Such was the cuſtome alſo of other countreis, whereſoeuer there was any religion or reuerence of God. What need I now againe put you in mind of the Chaldees and theyr Wiſe men, the Egyptians and theyr Prieſts, the Grecians &amp; their Prophets, the Romaines and their Sooth-ſaiers, the French with theyr Druidiſts, without whoſe more ſage aduice, it was alwaies thought a thing ominous, once to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt any notable thing in the common wealth. Neither were they deceiued in their opinion: For was the neglect of God euer left without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge? Yea the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of falſe gods contemned, hath found the true God a ſharp reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger: wherfore al antiquity thought well, that nothing could goe well in the common wealth,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8306:115"/> without due reuerence done to Religion: they began theyr wars with Religion, they ended their wars with Religion.</p>
               <p>But whence in Gods name (if it can be in Gods name) is this error ſprong vp among thoſe which glory in the true religion, that they diſdayn in their counſels to take counſell of religion? Verily where God is baniſhed publike aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies, &amp; religion is made but a ſcorn to the wicked, &amp; the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth a priuate gayne to euery varlet; happy Biſhops, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Miniſters of the Church which are fartheſt off from ſuch Godleſſe and irreligious conuenticles. <hi>Bleſſed is that man that hath not walked in the counſell of the vngodly, and hath not ſtood in the way of ſinners, &amp; hath not ſit in the chair of the ſcornful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time hath ben vnder our Lord Chriſt, when Biſhops thought it not agreable with their honor, to ſit in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Emperors: whether it were of any ſuperſtitious error of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or of any contagious miſdemeanor of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorians, I cannot wel tell; but this I am ſure of, that it is no <hi>indecorum</hi> for the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt, to be ſeen in the <hi>congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of God. <hi>God ſtandeth in the congregation of Gods, the iudgeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Gods.</hi> But it ther, the counſels were held for priuat gain, or priuy deceit, for wicked treaſons, or bloudy murthers, no wonder though the godly BB. were aſhamed to ſtand in the vngodly aſſemblies: For albeit God be there alſo, as iudge &amp; reuenger, yet the diuel is ther preſent, as Preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: otherwiſe ther was no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why it might not be a thing decent &amp; conueuient too, for a B. to ſtand in the conſiſtory, (Admitte him) as a Doctor to giue aduice according to the word, as Legat for the Prince or the eſtate, as a Solicitor for the widow &amp; the orphan, for the poore &amp; the oppreſſed, for the traduced and condemned. This was then alſo a religious cuſtom among the moſt ancient &amp; beſt conceiued Biſhops.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did, &amp; what he thought in this caſe, himſelf witneſſeth of himſelfe in his firſt Booke the 27. Epiſtle: who euen then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he excuſed himſelf to the Emperor <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> for that he would not diſpute with <hi>Auxe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius</hi> the Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> B. in his Pallace, yet euen ther alſo he acknowledgeth his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that behalfe, ſaing: <hi>Wherfore take it in good worth</hi> (gratious
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8306:116"/> Emperour) <hi>that I can not now come to the Conſiſtory: For I haue not acquainted my ſelfe to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the Conſiſtory, but on your behalfe: Neyther can I willingly contend within the compaſſe of your Court, who nor know, nor ſeeke to knowe the the ſecretes of the Court.</hi> So that albeit <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thought it not beſeeming the dignity of a Biſhop, to ſtand as an ordinary man in the throng of the conſiſtorians, yet he thought it pertaining to his duety, to be there preſent in the Princes cauſes, and the affaires of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth. Wherfore, whenceſoeuer this perſwaſion ſprong, &amp; whoſoeuer they be, which thinke it either an vnlawfull, or an vnſeemly thing, for any Miniſter to intermedle in ciuill cauſes, they doe greatly wrong the honour of religion, the welfare of Princes, and the publique ſtate, whome they enuy the good vſe, graue aduice, and louing fidelity of ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cittizens and ſubiects of the common wealth.</p>
               <p>If the honeſt examples of ancient Biſhops might be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny autority at this day, I would reckon vp many honorable Legacies vndertaken by moſt reuerend Biſhops in ciuil cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but ther are two preſidents which may ſufficiently ſerue for our purpoſe. The firſt is that of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> who was twiſe Embaſſador for the Emperor <hi>Valentinian,</hi> to the Tirant <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus;</hi> &amp; that, not without great ſucceſſe: the other is that of <hi>Marutha</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Meſapotamia,</hi> whom the Romaine Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſent Embaſſador to the king of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in his ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th boke of Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories: the which his one Embaſſee was aboundantly beneficiall, both to the Church, and alſo to the Emperour himſelfe. By theſe reaſons and examples I am drawen to this concluſion, that it is both lawful and requiſit for Princes, to demiſe certaine ciuil cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes &amp; affairs to the ancients of the Clergy; and that it is but the error of them which luſt to go alone though they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrye, that thinke, that the Miniſter ought to bee ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred from all ciuill affayres, in a chriſtian common wealth. As for thoſe wordes of our Sauiour, and the tradition of the Apoſtles, they teach vs no other thing then this; That no publique ciuil authority is ioyned with the Ecceſiaſticall Miniſtery, as any part thereof. But the ſtate of the Church
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8306:116"/> being altered; where the Church is the Common-wealth, and the Common-wealth the Church, there the ſtate of the Euangelique Miniſters, may lawfully bee the ſame, which was of olde in the Prieſts and Leuites among the people of God.</p>

But this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction hath no place in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people. In times paſt, when chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were mingled with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as at this day they are among the Mahometiſts, it was then of force a part by it ſelfe, and it might be ſaid, the Church is in the Common-welth, as the people of <hi>Iſraell</hi> were ſometimes in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or at <hi>Babylon.</hi> I touch not now that ſtate of a Common-welth, in the which the head-ſtrong people are diſtracted into diuerſe factions, and the headleſſe Churches are diſmembred vnder the ſame Magiſtrate. That is a waightie matter indeed, and ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a proper treatiſe of it ſelfe. But where the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath giuen their names vnto Chriſt, and there is no man which is not ſprinckled in his Baptiſme, there doubtles the Church is the Common-wealth, and the Common-wealth the viſible Church: vnder the which who ſo ſupplieth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of the one onely, or in regard of both names (the order appointed by God being kept, and thoſe things
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8306:117"/> remaining diuerſe, which in nature are diſtinct) there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Goſpell that forbiddeth the ſame.</p>
               <p>In that a man is Paſtor of the people, or Biſhop of the Church, hee holdeth of Chriſt: in that hee is a ſubiect and a tenaunt to the Common-wealth, hee holdeth of the Prince: that he may performe his dutie to both theſe, he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to giue ouer either of theſe: the ſame man may giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> thoſe things which are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and neuertheleſſe, performe that vnto God which is due vnto God. A Biſhop, as hee is a Paſtor, doth owe vnto Chriſt a vigilant care ouer the flocke committed vnto his charge; and as hee is a ſubiect and free Cittizen, hee oweth vnto his Prince faithfull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, dutiful homage, and all other kinds of lawfull ſeruice.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould ſo fall out at this day, (as it hath doone full oft and full well) that ſome noble-man holding in fee of the King, ſhould bee called vnto the Miniſtery, (as one which hath ſufficient learning, and no leſſe deuotion) the doctrine of the Goſpell doth not prohibit, that ſuch a man ſhould be made a Biſhop, and yet retaine his free holde and the royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging there-unto. (Alwaies to bee conſidered, that the lawes of the Common-wealth permit the ſame.) Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any cauſe, why any man ſhould thinke, that this Biſhop would be caried away with his ſecular affaires from his paſtorall charge: For if there be any feare of God in him, and if he haue any care of the Church, hee will honeſtly, and may eaſily prouide, that ſuch things be diſcharged by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and wil gouerne his Church himſelfe. We ſee that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-men haue the ſurpluſage of as much time from their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs, to diſpend in idle repaſts, as might well ſuffice a Paſtorall charge. And therfore it is not the poſſeſſions of the Kings farms and fees, which do ſo alienate a man, as that he cannot be both Lord of them, and a good Biſhop too. And therfore, if any chriſtian King ſhal thinke it behooful, either for the honor of his eſtate, or the ſtay of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, that certain BB. of the church ſhuld hold in fee either manors or honors by their priuilege, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not find that ether he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to grant &amp; demiſe; or that they are commaunded not

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F ſo be any man vrge vs any further, and ſay, that the oblations which are made in the Church, with the which, as well God himſelfe as his ſeruants are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, are vtterly oppoſit to the nature of fees: becauſe they are offered to teſtifie the gratefull memory of ſome benefite receiued: But contrariwiſe, a fee is graunted by the Lorde thereof vpon that condition, that the tenant in fee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the doner in ſome kind of duty for a benefit beſtowed. And therefore, ſeeing theſe two are oppoſite between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and in condition croſſe each other, it ſeemeth that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Paſtors are not rightfully indued with the title of fees: and this alſo is made good vppon them by this reaſon. Thoſe thinges which are giuen to the Paſtors of the Church, in regard of their miniſtery, are in the nature of certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and are reputed amongſt the holy actions of religion, which are to be rewarded of God onely: And therfore, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in lieu of them any temporal recompence, or ciuil ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequie, is a thing no leſſe prepoſterous, then irreligious: but fees are granted vpon that condition that the feudatory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize his Patron in ſome kind of perſonall (or proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable) dutie: &amp; therefore our aunceſtors haue not wel done, to honor the Church with their indowments of fees. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Church-goods which before I remembred, doth containe a very eaſie &amp; plaine anſwer to all this: namely, that the goods of the Church, are partly <hi>ſacred and diuine,</hi> partlie <hi>ciuill and humaine.</hi> For fees are ciuil goods, &amp; therefore not to be numbred among oblations, but donations: neither were thoſe Cities and ſuburbs which were giuen by the people of God to Prieſts &amp; Leuits, at any time recounted among their offeringes. Beſides this, there is a difference betweene theſe things, <hi>to offer ſom thing to God, &amp; to giue any thing to the church.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:8306:118"/>
               <p>Things mooueable, which do periſh togeather with their very vſe, are ſaid to bee offered vnto God, when they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to his Miniſters, or to his poore members for Gods-ſake, (albeit the one hath the name of a gift, the other of an Almes.) The which thing, for that the benefit thereof hath the nature of an oblation, or ſacrifice, (for neither are they giuen for any reward, nor receaued vppon any condicion,) therefore, in nature they are nothing alike vnto the donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fees, as themſelues very well confeſſe. I admit they alſo oblige a man to a gratefull memorie of that they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued: yet are they not giuen vppon that condicion, that there-vpon ſome dutie ſhould be performed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing that the donation of fees, are neither in vſe, nor in ſenſe like vnto the religion of oblations, why ſhuld they be confounded with them? Or how ſhould a man ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly argue from thence, that the Miniſters of the church may not be endewed ther with? Are they not Cittizens and ſubiectes, and liue vnder the ſame lawe, and obey the ſame Magiſtrate, and beare the ſame burdens of the Common-wealth? By what equity then can they be abridged the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of ciuill goods, by the benefit of the Prince &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth?</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſeeing it is thought but equall by the conſent of the holy Fathers, that the fieldes and farmes of the Church, ſhould yeeld a tribute vnder the moſt Chriſtian Princes; that the increaſe and benefite of thoſe fees, ſhould ſerue for the good, partly of the Church, partly of the Prince, &amp; partly of the Common-wealth, it is not repugnant to the ſtate of the Church, or ſtay of religion. And indeed, why ſhould not the ſame thing betide their fields, which befall the perſons the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? who albeit they are dedicate to God, &amp; mancipate to his ſeruice, yet they commit nothing vnworthy their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or not beſeeming their calling, when as according vnto the dignity of their place, they performe due ſeruice to their Prince, and other duties to the common-wealth.</p>
               <p>That which is added of the penſion, or ſtipend of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, is eaſily anſwered by the ſame reaſon: for it differeth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8306:118"/> not from the other. Wherfore as a man may conſecrate him ſelfe and his labours to God and the Church, &amp; yet reſerue his due obſequie to his Prince and the common-wealth: ſo likewiſe may the Church inioy both fields, and fearms, and fees in the common-wealth, and yet make no claime to any extraordinary immunity from ſeruice, nor euer think much of any ordinary fealtie, due to the patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s therof. The Biſhop and euery other Miniſter of the Church, is ſubiect to the lawes and Magiſtrate of the common-wealth: and ſeeing he oweth homage to the Prince, as to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon parent of the people: there is no abſurditie committed, if by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of ſome eſpecial benefit he become more nearly bound vnto him, then the common ſort.</p>
               <p>How many and how bloudie wars the Biſhops of Rome haue made vpon the Emperours, and other Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, euen for the onely inueſtiture of thoſe fees which they chalenge vnto themſelues as conſecrate to God, &amp; therefore (as they perſwaded themſelues) free from all ciuill ſeruice, all hiſtories can well witneſſe. Wherefore thoſe Magiſtrates at this day doe ſhew themſelues very ingrate, (I may ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly) to the preſent Miniſterie; who, when as by defending the authoritie of the ciuill Magiſtrate, which the Biſhop of Rome had impayred, they haue now at the length brought to paſſe, that they haue recouered the ſame by their means, doe now notwithſtanding enuie them their poore eſtate in the Church, and their ſmall authoritie in the common-wealth. May not that of the Apoſtle (2. Cor. 11.19.) be truly ſaid of this people? <hi>They ſuffered thoſe gladly which brought them into bondage, which tooke of their goodes, which exalted themſelues, which ſmote them on the face;</hi> I more, which afflicted them with fire and ſworde, and made them runne through Purgatorie, glad that they might get to Hell. But the faithfull ſeruantes of Chriſt, which ſet them free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the captiuitie of the Pope, and gaue them that libertie which they nowe abuſe againſt the Church, thoſe they doe not onely not reward with that honour they well deſerued, but they depriue them of thoſe dignities they once poſſeſſed: They lay baites for the bane
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8306:119"/> for ſome, &amp; ſet ſnares for the liues of others, &amp; contriue plots for the depoſing and diſparaging of all. Is this the thankes they giue to their Paſtors? And is this the reward for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefits receiued by their preaching? O God forgiue them this ſin, if it be poſsible. But thou wilt one day iudge betweene them and vs, and reuenge this infamie done vnto thy ſelfe.</p>

Neither will I ſeeke into all, but will ſhew you vnto a few of them, and compriſe in one or two all the reſt, which either the cuſtome of the time &amp; place, or the curteſie of Kings and Princes, doe giue vnto the chiefe ſtates of the kingdome. With the which here are ſome in England, which find themſelues not a little of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, &amp; would hold others in hand (thogh they dare not hold their hand) that ſuch titles are not to bee giuen to the greateſt Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The firſt that diſpleaſeth them, is the title of <hi>Lord,</hi> which yet at this day is vſed to be giuen rather for honor ſake, then for homage. The proper ſignification thereof is ſufficiently known, to haue relation to the poſſeſſion &amp; proprietie of a thing: In which ſenſe, euery man is <hi>Lord</hi> of that hee hath. It hath a ſecondary relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo to a Seruant: in which ſenſe the Romane Emperours would not be called <hi>Lords,</hi> or <hi>Maisters. Suetonius</hi> reporteth of <hi>Octauius,</hi> that he abhorred the name of <hi>Lord</hi> &amp; <hi>Maister,</hi> as curſe, and a ſlaunder. Indeed the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> acknowledge no other diſtinction of perſons, but of Maiſters &amp; Seruants: &amp; therfore their Kings alſo do domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer ouer their ſubiects, as maiſters ouer their ſeruants; &amp; the fathers of families haue the ſame authoritie ouer their wiues &amp; children, as ouer their ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. This would ſeem (&amp; might
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:8306:119"/> well) a very vnreaſonable thing to vs, being not (as they are) a people baſe &amp; ſeruile. And yet the <hi>Moſchouites</hi> rule at this day after this manner; neither is the Empire of the <hi>Turkes</hi> much vnlike the ſame. And generally, all the Eaſterne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were once of this gouernment, &amp; kept this foule rule ouer the nations wher they conquered. (Whether the Kings kindred had any priuilege beſides the reſt, it is to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; ſo I leaue it.) But theſe a man might truly cal <hi>Dominos,</hi> Lords, or Maiſters: in which ſenſe our Kings themſelues wil not be ſo called: nor will they take it in good part to be ſo ſlandered; for their ſubiects are not their ſlaues, or ſeruants, neither do they ſo vſe them. They hold it their chiefeſt glory to haue a free people ſubiect vnto them; and thinke it more honorable, to command ouer a free then a ſeruile nation.</p>
               <p>And albeit the King may truly be called <hi>Lord,</hi> and indeed the only chiefe Lord in his own kingdom (referring the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of that title, either to the ſubiection of the whole people, or the propriety of his own kingdome) yet conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf with the royal title of King, (which glory he wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with no ſubiect) he enuieth not his ſubiects the name of <hi>Lords,</hi> but who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thinketh worthy, hee honoureth with that title. Neither do inferior perſons only cal ſuperior perſonages <hi>Lords,</hi> but they alſo which are Nobles of equall authoritie do ſo ſalute their peeres. And doth not the King himſelfe vouchſafe to greet the Honors of his lande by the names of <hi>Lords?</hi> The name of <hi>Lord</hi> is of many ſignifications, and is (as I haue ſaid) a title rather of honour and of fauor, then of rule and of Empire: the which argueth the no ſmal malice, or otherwiſe the great ignorance of them, which hold the title of <hi>Lord</hi> to bee of ſo great authoritie, as that it is not conuenable to the calling of Biſhops. And yet at this day among the beſt Latiniſtes, the ſame name ordinarily is giuen to any man of any ordinary eſteeme. So doth the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of this title varie, according to the diuerſitie of regions, and perſons, and proprieties.</p>
               <p>They which in England do make the ſame a ſignification of greater honor, then that it may any waies agree with their
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:8306:120"/> Biſhops doe ground that their errour vpon an other, by the which they are perſwaded that it is a thing inſolent and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, for Biſhops to bee taken for peeres of the lande. But herein they ſeeme to bewray themſelues in like paſſion with the ſons of <hi>Iacob,</hi> when they enuyed their owne brother, for that he was made more honourable then themſelues; who ought rather to haue thought themſelues honored in their brother. It is vtterly againſt the nature of a well ordered common-wealth, that the order of religion ſhould not bee accounted among the chiefe ſtates of the lande: the which honour ſeeing it cannot bee giuen to all that are in the ſame order, it is wiſely and worthily prouided by the chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, that the whole order ſhould be honored in a few of them. The which thing ſeeing it is agreeable to the lawe of God, and the cuſtome of the auncient people of God, &amp; the practiſe of al Nations vnder the Sun; may it not ſeem a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der greater then their errour, that any learned men ſhould be found in any wildernes of the world ſo ouergrown with moſſe, (the melancholie of their diſtempered brains) as once to oppoſe themſelues in any ciuill ſocietie againſt the ſame?</p>
               <p>But let vs heare yet, with what reaſons they are moued ſo farre beyond all reaſon. Thoſe proud titles (ſay they) of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, are the inuentions of Antichriſt: and our Sauiour anſwered his Apoſtles contending about the primacie, <hi>That the kings of nations rule ouer them, and they which exerciſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie vpon them are called gratious Lords; but it ſhall not bee ſo with you.</hi> And in the 23. of <hi>Mathew: You ſhall call no man your father vpon earth, for there is one your father which is in heauen: bee not called Doctors, for one is your Doctor, euen Chriſt.</hi> Whatſoeuer els is alleadged is of ſmal worth: &amp; theſe words of our Sauiour beeing honeſtly interteined, the reſt will willingly yeelde themſelues.</p>
               <p>Firſt therfore I affirme, that the titles of <hi>dominion</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, before Antichriſt himſelfe was hatched, hee beeing the author thereof, who is the author of <hi>dominion.</hi> Neyther is there any thing arrogant in the titles, but in the impotent and vſurped aſpirement of ſuch, which oft times reiecting
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:8306:120"/> their commendable titles affect the contrary, and cal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <hi>ſeruants of ſeruants,</hi> which thinke themſelues <hi>Lordes of Lords:</hi> &amp; name themſelues with the <hi>leſſe</hi> and the <hi>least,</hi> which will bee accounted the <hi>greater</hi> &amp; the <hi>greateſt,</hi> that if for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, yet for that they are ſo named. But the Lorde his meaning was not to aboliſh the vſe of theſe titles, <hi>Lord, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> but to teach vs onely by theſe his precepts, to beware of two dangerous perrils: The firſt is, the vaine ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or ſwelling veine with the which Hypocrites are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly puft vp by reaſo of theſe titles: the other is, the prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous confidence which the ſimple people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly haue in their elected Doctors, or Fathers: vppon which aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the popular profeſſors diſtract the name of Chriſt, ſo that ſome hold of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome of <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llo,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and euery man beſt fancieth the <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf hath choſen: when as no man ought to build vpon any Doctors wordes, but on his alone which cannot erre (the Lord Chriſt.) Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it the Lord his intent to inhibit vs, that we ſhould not call thoſe by their names, vnto whom the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the names of <hi>Doctors</hi> &amp; <hi>Fathers</hi> in the Church, or that children ſhould not cal them <hi>Fathers</hi> vpon earth, that begot them into the world; or that Diſciples ſhould not cal them <hi>Doctors</hi> in the Cittie, that inſtructed them in the Vniuerſity; or that Chriſtian ſeruants ſhould not cal them <hi>Lords</hi> &amp; <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> which haue intertained them into their families. No doubt <hi>Oneſimus</hi> both might &amp; ought to call and recogniſe <hi>Philemon</hi> for his Maiſter: And did not <hi>Paul</hi> alſo (a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect imitater of Chriſt) cal himſelf the <hi>Doctor</hi> of the Gentiles? And why may not we alſo cal him, as well a <hi>Doctor</hi> as an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle?</hi> In the firſt to the Corinthians, chap. 4. he calleth himſelfe theyr <hi>Father. Although</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>you haue ten thouſand inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Christ, yet haue you not many</hi> Fathers; <hi>for I haue begotten you through the Goſpell.</hi> The like we reade in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: by the which we are giuen to vnderſtand, that not the condition, but the ambition onely of thoſe names was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, with the ſingling out of ſome eſpeciall Doctor, or Teacher, by the which wee will ſhew our ſelues to be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:8306:121"/> For that indeed that knowledge of the truth, which we would ſeem to experience in ſome eſpeciall men, is onely to be expected in that <hi>Doctor</hi> alone, who with the Spirit is able to lead vs into all truth.</p>
               <p>But now, what ſhall we ſay of the name &amp; title of <hi>Lordes?</hi> Firſt I ſay, it is no where written; <hi>Be ye not called Lordes:</hi> And againe I ſay, that although it were written, it could beare no other ſence, or haue any other interpretation, then thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther titles which before are noted. That dominion ouer the Lordes heritage is forbidden by the Lord, there is no man that doubteth: and did the word <hi>Lord</hi> alwaies implie a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> it were ſome thing they ſaide. But we haue heard of the diuers ſignifications of theſe words. As for that the Lord ſaid vnto his Apoſtles, <hi>It ſhal not be ſo with you;</hi> what ſober ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil interprete him, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not be called Lords?</hi> If the Kinges and Princes of the common-wealth, will haue you to ſit in the aſſemblies of great men, and wil heare your iudgement concerning the ſtate of the Church, and will conſult together with you concerning the affaires of the common-wealth, and in regarde of my name, and in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your calling, wil haue you reputed among the peers of the land, take heede, beware of that, and ſuffer not your ſelues to bee called <hi>Lordes:</hi> this is a proud title, and that is a foule matter. From hence no doubt did ariſe that odious hypocriſie in the Church of Rome, which vnder the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mean titles, exerciſeth the ſharpnes of no meane tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and vnder the name of Seruant of ſeruantes, vſurpeth dominion ouer Maiſters and Seruants. And hence it is alſo, that his champions do glory in this, to be called Friers (Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norites) <hi>the leſſe,</hi> or <hi>the least:</hi> as if forſooth there were, nor pride, nor tyranny lurking vnder theſe their lubarly names: or as if the name of <hi>Lord</hi> onely, were to bee attended with pride and tyrannie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, the meaning of our Sauiour in thoſe words, was not to forbid his diſciples thoſe ordinary tearms of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which are giuen them by the fauor of the Prince, and conſent of the people: only his intent was to teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:8306:121"/> the Goſpel was no prince-like Miniſtery, or royal ſeigniory. By the which it neither is, nor can be concluded, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may by no means vſe the aſsiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Miniſters, nor grace the learned Paſtors with certaine principall degrees of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Hath Chriſt by any law diminiſhed the Princes power? or hath he by any counſell aduiſed them to withdraw their bountie from his ſeruantes? or that they ſhould haue no regard of thoſe duties they haue performed? or not to grace with titles of honour their honeſt demerits, of whoſe truth &amp; wiſdom they haue made great vſe, &amp; had great experience? <hi>Nabuchadnezer</hi> preferred <hi>Daniel</hi> amongſt the <hi>Babilonians; Darius</hi> aduanced <hi>Mardocheus</hi> among the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and ſhall it not be lawfull for a Chriſtian King to honor the ſeruants of Chriſt for their religion? &amp; that vpon a certain religion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth? That the meane may be exceeded, no man doubteth; namely, when as diuine honors are giuen to mortal men; or where immoderate dignities are ambitiouſly affected of them, who ought to be the patterns of modeſtie, &amp; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of humilitie: but yet, that ciuil honour cannot bee thought immoderate (but of immoderate men) which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of the Cuntry, is giuen for iuſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by the aduiſed Prince to his approued Subiects.</p>
               <p>How many moſt holy men, whoſe liues were only priuat, (yet publikly renowned) which haue ſuffered themſelues to be called <hi>Lords?</hi> witneſſe the two Teſtaments.<note place="margin">3. Reg. 18.</note> Did not <hi>Abdias</hi> the ſeruant of K. <hi>Achab,</hi> meeting with <hi>Elias,</hi> ſalute him by the name of Lord?<note place="margin">4. Reg. 4.</note> Was not <hi>Elizeus</hi> honored of the <hi>Sunamite</hi> by the name of Lord? Did not the keeper of the priſon call <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> by the name of Lordes?<note place="margin">Acts. 16.</note> And yet the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie of their mindes notwithſtanding was no leſſe, then that of <hi>Peter,</hi> who would not ſuffer himſelfe to bee hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Cornelius</hi> aboue meaſure. We read of <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas,</hi> how they rent their clothes, and ran into the throng, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed the diuine honors which <hi>Iupiters</hi> Prieſt, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, would haue done vnto them; and verely, if ſo bee in the name of <hi>Lord,</hi> ther had bene any ſuch eminent honor, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, as ſom think, they would haue refuſed that.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8306:122"/> I conclude therefore, that in a Chriſtian common-wealth, which is the Church of Chriſt, all externe things, as wealth, riches, preferment, and ciuill honours, may bee referred of all and euerie the faythfull, of any calling or condition whatſoeuer, to the glorie of GOD, and the good of the Church, and the benefite of the common-wealth. (For ſo indeede they ought to bee referred.) With the which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this alſo, that the ſeruantes of Chriſt ought ſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelues, both for honour and ignominie, both for wealth and want, as that they may vſe all thinges aright, to the honour of God, and edifiyng of his Church.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eſides all this, the Biſhops retinue &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie attendants, are no ſmall motes in the eies of ſome, that cannot without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie behold the ſame. For doe they not therein imitate the peeres and potentates of the lande? Not Chriſt (I warrant you) not <hi>Peter,</hi> not <hi>Paule,</hi> were euer thus gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But alâs poore popular, and child-pleaſing ſpeech: ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are the men, whom theſe faire wordes make faine: for I dare be bold to ſay, that the retinue of Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles was as honorable as it might be, in reſpect of the time, &amp; the thing for the which he came into the world; &amp; much more honorable ſhould haue beene, if God had meant to reſtore mankind after an other ſort then he did. And yet as it was, our Lord and Sauiour was not without aboue foureſcore men in his family, which waited vpon him whither he went, or went before him whither he was to come.</p>
               <p>I, but there were no gallant Gentlemen to braue it in their chains of gold, there were no barbed ſteeds to praunce it in their ſiluer ſtudded raynes: In that ſolemne pompe, when Chriſt would ſhewe his glorie vnto the Cittie, hee was well
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8306:122"/> mounted vppon a ſorie Aſſe, attended with the ſimple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of his weake Diſciples. I, but this againe is but a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſwaſion, in the which ther is nor pith nor rind againſt the thing in queſtion. Will they neuer learne, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our after that manner prouided for that ſeaſon, leaſt eyther hee ſhould incurre the ſuſpicion of affecting an earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or other-wiſe might haue hindered the worke of our redemption? Doubtles, had he bene knowen in his kind to <hi>Herod,</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and to the chiefe Prieſts: that which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did of a good zeale, they would haue done for their own aduancement; but then would they neuer haue <hi>crucified the Lord of glorie:</hi> Neither would he which tooke in good worth the honor of that oyntment which was powred vpon him, and receiued royall preſents of the wiſe men, (golde, myrhe, and frankincenſe,) haue euer refuſed that honour which was due vnto him from all earthly Princes, might it haue ſtoode with the ſaluation of mankind. But is not this a worthy kind of arguing (which is vſed aſwel againſt the Papiſts as againſt vs) to reaſon from the times &amp; actions of a faithles people, to the times and duties of a chriſtian nation? neither doe I commend in our Biſhops, either pride or ryot, or any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous exceſſe; but this I ſay, that that retinue is not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alowed, which the receaued and continued cuſtome of the countrey requireth.</p>
               <p>It was an auncient cuſtome in the Church, that a Biſhop ſhould neuer walke forth alone, or be alone: hee had records and eie-witneſſes of al his actions. Now they which are more indifferent to Biſhops, had rather they ſhould bee attended with gown-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the which I alſo had rather. But let vs weigh the matter in an euen ballaunce: for they which would haue the Biſhops retinue to be men of his owne quality, ſeeme to ſay ſome-what, and to ſtand to the examples of the ancient Fathers. But it is wel knowen that our BB. are neuer without ſuch alſo. Wherefore, the queſtion is now of the number: which cannot bee preſcribed to all alike, for that their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues are not all alike. But go too: let vs once againe alow Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops their <hi>ancient attendants.</hi> The more there is of them, the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8306:123"/> greater is his family, &amp; ſo a greater number of ſeruants, and ſo a greater retenue by ods, then is as this day: and ſhall not their enuy alſo increaſe with the company for company?</p>
               <p>But the ſeruing mens ſwords, and the Gentlemens chains do gall them at the heart, and paine them in their eies, as if (good men) it were a thing miſbeſeming the calling of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that a Biſhop ſhuld be attended by Gentlemen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old or young? That yong Gentlemen and wel nurtered, ſhould be preferred to ſome godly BB. that they may attend his perſon, and marke his maners, &amp; therby become the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and better learned: there no is no man without an enuious eye, that can miſlike the ſame. Biſhops houſes haue bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies Colliges of learned men, and ſchooles of al virtue; and what hindreth that they may not now be? But leaſt I ſhould ſeme to haue taken vpon me the patrociny, rather of BB. then of their calling, I may not ſeeme to ſet forth the virtues of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which at this day do gouern the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And yet, neither the zeale of my duty, nor the conſcience of their demerits will ſuffer me, to paſſe ouer in thankles ſilence the ſacred memory of that moſt reuerend Father, <hi>Iohn,</hi> L. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with that godly Dioceſſan <hi>VVilliam,</hi> L. Biſhop of <hi>Couentry,</hi> mine own Ordinary. As for the reſt, they are all known to me alike. I knew ſome-times, (neither ſhall they euer bee vnknowen) that moſt reuerend L. and Father <hi>Edward Grindall,</hi> (the memorye of which man is renowned in all the Churches of Chriſt:) and two other BB. no leſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their learning and religion, <hi>Iewell</hi> L.

Biſhop of <hi>VVinchester:</hi> whoſe religious godlines &amp; rare knowledg, I could wiſh that al the BB. euil-pleaſed emuliſts had among them, euery man his part. What other Biſhoppes and Archbiſhops happy. <hi>England</hi> hath bred within our memory, their lerned works declame in our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their inflamed bloud doth yet ſpeake in the booke of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> That they were men both of ſincere life and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular learning, what man, (if a man) that will deny it? I te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie therefore, that I do not defend Biſhops (if there be any euill,) but the calling of Biſhops, which in my conſcience I
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8306:123"/> iudge before God (who ſhall iudge my conſcience) to bee godly, chriſtian, ancient, Apoſtolike, profitable, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As for the crimes and abuſes, with the which the euil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits charge our Biſhoppes, they touch their perſon, not their function. The tyranny of <hi>Rome</hi> being ſurpriſed, &amp; the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Princes reſtored to their right places, wherin ſo-euer any Biſhop offendeth (if indeed hee offendeth) it may eaſily be corrected: and it chiefly concerneth the chiefe Magiſtrate to ſee, that godly men, well noted for their virtues, (ſuch as the word of God doth commend) be ſet ouer the churches: If the Princes neglect this, let the peple know, that <hi>ſciſme</hi> is a remedy worſe then the malady: for what ſedicion is in the Common-welth, the ſame is ſciſme in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And albeit theſe things doe litle concerne thoſe churches which are committed to your charge (reuerend Brethren,) where there are no Biſhops, or rather where they are all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: notwithſtanding, I haue more largely dilated of theſe things, that the whole matter may be made manifeſt vnto al you, and that you all may vnderſtand, that the honor which is giuen vnto Biſhops, is both an aid and an aduauncement to the Church or chriſtian Common-wealth; and that you may take aime by this, how farre wide they are, which inuey them this honor, &amp; deſire to make them, or to make no more of them, then of ordinary men. That which I am perſwaded, <hi>Satan</hi> with a certain wile hath procured, that ſo he may bring downe all the Paſtors into contempt togeather, that ſo the whole authority of religion being little or naught woorth, himſelfe might freely caſt forth al manner contumelies and blaſphemies againſt Chriſt. For who are they (which durſt, oppoſe, or could preuaile againſt the enterpriſes of his more mightie complices? I know what I ſpeake, neither can you (beloued) bee ignorant thereof. But I haue ſaid enough of this matter for this time: and wil one day (if God wil) ſpeak more plainely of that which remaineth.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Whether it be better for Miniſters to liue of the ſtipends of the Magistrate, or of the oblations of the faithfull.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>L they which thinke, that the Miniſters of the Goſpell may liue of the Goſpell, are not of one iudgement: For there bee ſome which hold, that Miniſters ought to liue of the <hi>tythes</hi> and <hi>oblations</hi> onely of Chriſtians, renouncing all temporall goods, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering them to the Prince and people. Other are of opinion, that they ought ſo to liue, for ſo long onely as the Magiſtrate is an enemy to chriſtianitie: who ſo ſoone as he hath receaued the Goſpel, ought to prouide, that Miniſters may be allotted their ſufficient ſtipends: the which thing when hee hath once performed, from thence foorth, there ought to be no more <hi>oblations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my part I am of a contrary opinion, for that I am taught by the word of God, that <hi>oblations</hi> ought to continue in the Church: and that, becauſe they are the exerciſes and teſtimonies of our religion towards God and his ſeruantes, by the which wee not onely pay our vowes to the Almighty, but therewith alſo the Paſtors to the people, and the people to the Paſtors are mutually deuoted the one to the other. For (I know not how) a man doth not onely binde with his bounty, but is bound himſelfe alſo, after a ſecret manner: And as the benefactor maketh him his owne of whome hee doth deſerue, ſo likewiſe himſelfe becommeth his, and they both, (if ſo be there be a free and an ingenious diſpoſition in both) reioyce in the ſame benefit, as wel he which giueth, as he which receiueth. Now therefore, me thinks theyr rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are too too politicke and prophane, by the which <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are abrogat in ſom Churches. For albeit religion ought not to be meaſured by allowance, yet is it not to be without a reward. As for that they ſo hotly alledge of the many and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:8306:124"/> manifold abuſes thereof, it is to no purpoſe: vnles we ſhould ſay, that the ceremonies alſo which were commaunded, were to be abrogated euen then while they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and all other ſacred rites which God hath ordained, were together to be aboliſhed, becauſe Hypocrites haue and doe wickedly abuſe the ſame. For what is there ſo ſacred, which the impiety of men will not prophane? Wherefore, we are rather to inquire, what God hath commaunded, not what this or that man thinketh moſt commodious.</p>
               <p>If any man obiect, that oblations are antiquated, as are alſo tithes, and all other ſacrifices and ceremonies of the old lawe; I would haue him to know (if he be yet to learne) that they are not exacted at this day in that manner, neyther were ſo exacted of our Fathers (as it may appeare by thoſe theyr teſtimonies which I haue before noted) but that they are onely required, as teſtimonies of a thankfull mind towards God, and a propenſiue deuotion towards his Church. But this kinde of duety hath no temporall preſcription, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and bindeth the faithfull to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>It is alſo obiected, that where the Paſtors are abundantly prouided for, by the ample reuenews of the Church, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet &amp; certaine ſtipends, there oblations ought to ceaſe. I aunſwere, that the oblations may be the leſſe or not ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as otherwiſe they ought to be, where the Church hath no fermes, or receyueth no annuall increaſe of theyr fieldes: but not, that there ought to be none. The end of oblations, is not only the neceſſary reliefe of the Miniſters, but our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull deuotion towards God. And hence is it, that the wiſe man ſayth in the third of his Prouerbes, <hi>Honor the</hi> Lord <hi>with thy riches, and with the firſt fruits of thine increaſe, &amp;c.</hi> He doth not ſay Honor the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> (who notwithſtanding was to bee honored, and was honored) but honor the <hi>Lord.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> to the Philippians the fourth Chapter, telleth them, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired not a gift, but the fruite which might abound for theyr reioycing, not for his. So then they which take away <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> depraue the faithfull of this fruite of theyr Religion,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.14.</note> and conſequently of that Communion of theyr goods,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8306:125"/> which good chriſtians ought to exerciſe betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Wherefore, as we haue proued, that it is lawfull for Paſtors to liue of the poſſeſſions which are giuen vnto Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the like do we ſay of oblations.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow let vs call their reaſons to an euen reckoning, which appoint Miniſters their maintenance by the Magiſtrate his allowance. For now a dayes this is thought a better deuiſe, then the ancient receyued vſe of offerings &amp; glebes. And reaſon too: for by this means, many inconueniences may be auoyded, which mans infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity bringeth with it. But theyr reaſons and arguments are of a new mold, &amp; not knowen to the Fathers, or not thought worthy, for the which oblations ſhould be depoſed from theyr former ſtate. Theyr firſt reaſon is this. That by this means an occaſion might be taken away, ſo that men could not ſo readily make marchandiſe of the word of God, which otherwiſe might be eaſie for them to doe, who imploying their whole Miniſtery to gain and vſury, would apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt, of whom they hoped to receiue moſt.</p>
               <p>I aunſwer, that the contrary may rather ſeeme more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing that the very couenanting for a ſtipend, is in the next degree to a flat bargayn (vnleſſe we would iudge bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining by giuing and taking, and meaſure the ſame by the minds of men rather then the matter.) For what other thing is it to marchandiſe, then to ſel any then for lucre ſake? But when the Magiſtrate ſetteth down a certain price for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters labor, or the Miniſter himſelfe requireth the ſame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in plain termes there is no bargain made of either ſide, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of both, theſe may ſeem rather to buy &amp; ſell the word, then they which liue by the oblations of the faithfull, or the increaſe of theyr fields. Oblations are not certayne, and they haue in them a certayne kinde of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but ſtipends are certaine, and are in theyr nature more ciuill, religious not at all. Now whether, I pray you, may be
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:8306:125"/> ſayd rather to ſell? He which in reſpect of his holy Miniſtery receyueth the free gifts of his people, or he which rateth his labour at a certaine ſet ſtipend? Our fore-fathers in wiſedom thought, that this religious marchandiſe of religion could by no meanes be better auoided, then if on both parts they made a religion in that very action of <hi>offering</hi> and <hi>receiuing.</hi> I conclude therfore, that this miſchiefe which ſom are affraid of, namely that the whole Miniſtery ſhould be giuen to gaine &amp; vſury, can neuer by this means be auoided in coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men: their minds being ſo affected (or infected rather) as that they would make a gaine of any thing, and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ready to conuay themſelues thither, wher the greateſt wages might be had.</p>
               <p>Againe (ſay they) that liberty of ſpeech which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a Miniſter, may thus be better performed: For of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall daily receiue ſomwhat, they either could not taxe their vice, or elſe they muſt doe it with loſſe to themſelues: but now where no man giueth any thing of his owne, they may admoniſh all degrees of men, with more boldneſſe and leſſe daunger.</p>
               <p>This reaſon partly confuteth it ſelfe, and may eaſely bee retorted, and partly falleth in his own ſtrength, and can no waies be relieued. For is it not to bee feared alſo, that the Miniſters ſhould ſpeak in fauor of them, of whom they take wages? Theſe men for the moſt part haue greater faults then the moſt part; and yet if the Paſtor chaunce but to ſtir their humor, their ſtipend is in hazard. Let a Preacher with his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty offend a whole multitude, he ſhal not endanger either himſelfe, or his eſtate ſo much, as if he diſpleaſe but one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat. As for liberty of ſpeach, it is generally a very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and plauſible thing, with the which while a few are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, many are well pleaſed, and the euill will of a few got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by this meanes, procureth the good will of a great many. Beſides, our Sauiour prouided but badlye for his Diſciples, (if this reaſon bee of any force) when as in the olde law hee commaunded the Prieſts and Leuites to liue of the <hi>oblations</hi> of the people, as alſo in the new Teſtament,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:8306:126"/> he would haue his Apoſtles and theyr ſucceſſors to liue of the Goſpell, If the daunger be ſuch, that therfore they may not taxe vice. But it ſeemeth, theſe men haue eyther not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned to the knowledge of <hi>oblations,</hi> or regard but a little what is read in the moſt ancient Diuines, concerning the ſame. Firſt he which thinketh, that by this meanes the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of flattery is taken away, greatly deceyueth himſelfe, &amp; raſhly condemneth the auncient Fathers. But goe to: let vs confer the Sermons of the Fathers which liued by <hi>oblations,</hi> and the ſeuerity of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline vſed in thoſe dayes, with the Sermons and proceedings of our Preachers of this age. Shall we not be aſhamed (if we bluſh not) of our ſelues and our times, in the which all vice are ſo riſe, and all diſcipline ſo ſlacke? doubtleſſe, that liberty of our Fathers in reprehending ſins of old, doth euen now reprehend vs. Again let the Paſtors Sermons, where they liue of the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, be compared with thoſe, where they ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the ſtipend of the Magiſtrate, and it will eaſely appeare whether of them doe beſt performe theyr duety in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. But laſt of all, what need they depend vppon the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary deuotion of the people, where beſides their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oblations, there are fayr glebes and ſufficient lands pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for the vſe of the Church? To the which we may alſo adde, that it is the duty of a chriſtian Magiſtrat, to cauſe the people to performe their duety towards theyr Paſtors: ſo that it is altogether a needeleſſe fear which is here alledged. And whereas they thinke that the ſuſpicion of flattery is by this meanes auoyded (as if they were in daunger to be ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in theyr ſinnes, which are rich, and giue with a full hand) it is but a fooliſhe conceit, ariſing from that error, that chriſtians are not <hi>bound</hi> to their <hi>oblations;</hi> or elſe of this nicety, that it is vnſeemely (forſooth) and ſuperſtitious to bring them to the Church, or otherwiſe to gather them. By the which in deede they haue made themſelues the patrons of the ſacriledge of this age, which hath left nothing for the Miniſters worthy the gathering vp: ſo that if there bee any want in oblations, there want muſt be ſupplied elſe where.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:8306:126"/>
               <p>But by certaine ſtipends (ſay they) the modeſty of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the honeſty of their family are prouided for. For what ingenious man would willingly make his neede know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to euery man? and with what face can they of the familye goe doore by doore to gather things neceſſary? verily their credite is indangered, and theyr modeſty.</p>
               <p>But did you euer heare, that the Miniſters of the Church were brought to ſuch an exigent, as that of force they muſt gather their relief from dore to dore, among their own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? In deed, there was ſuch a cuſtome in the time of Popery for mendicant Friers, brought vp among them of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſuperſtition, without any precedent preſident of the auncient Fathers. But is there no other way to gather chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian oblations, but ſo? and are they not eyther brought by the faithfull of theyr own voluntary, or collected by ſome of the honeſt neighbours appointed for that purpoſe? But of the other ſide, by the certaine ſtipends which depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the vncertaine pleaſures of the Magiſtrates, it is very badly prouided, both for the neceſſity of the family, and the modeſty of the Miniſters, where either ſo ſmall wages are allowed, or their allowance ſo ſlenderly paied, that the poor Paſtors (pittifull complayning) for meere pouerty are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to giue ouer theyr trade, and to forſake theyr Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery. Where the people are perſwaded, that they owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to theyr Paſtors, and that it pertaineth to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate onely to prouide for the Miniſters (alâcke poore Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors) I am aſhamed to report, how both people and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate beare themſelues towards them.</p>
               <p>But furthermore they diſpute,, that in theſe ſtipends the Miniſters can vſe no deceite, when it ſhalbe ſufficiently kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, how much they receiue: when as otherwiſe, a couetous Miniſter may pretend, that eyther he receiueth leſſe then he receiueth, or not ſo much as ſufficeth.</p>
               <p>To this I aunſwere, that the oblations, of the which we argue the caſe, are not ſo ſecretly giuen, or ſo cloſely kept, but that it is commonly knowen how much they are, and what the Miniſter receiueth. But to what purpoſe is al this?
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8306:127"/> or to what end ſhould al know how much the miniſter either receyueth, or hath? or who can preſcribe a meane for that matter? The Paſtor layeth out as well as he taketh in: &amp; muſt that alſo needs be knowen? That which they adde, of the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteous</hi> Miniſter, who may pretend that he receyueth leſſe, then either he receiueth, or may well ſuffice, it proceedeth of the ſame errour. I haue knowen many Miniſters in my time, among whome there is not one, whoſe wealth is not commonly knowen, and what he ordinarily receyueth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year; ſo that there is no other means for them to lie here, then there, vnleſſe you would lie for them. But to what end are theſe reaſons? or how, thinke they, did the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Church liue? <hi>Ignatius, Ireneus, Cornelius, Cyprian,</hi> and ſuch like, whoſe memorial wil continue with their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the worlds end? A man ſhall neuer preuent the cauels of malitious men, whether the Miniſters liue of tithes and oblations, or whether they ſtick to theyr certain allowance: both here, and there, whatſoeuer is receiued wil be thought too much of ſome.<note place="margin">A Flemiſhe florence or gilderne, is 2. ſhillings ſterling.</note> I haue often times heard the Boores groyn and grunt to this effect, that a ſtipend of two, three or foure hundred Flemiſh Florences was great wages. I (ſayd they) can keepe my family for leſſe: Neyther do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue ſo much of all the gayne that I can make; thus vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually comparing not them ſelues with them ſelues, but theyr ſtyes with the ſtate of they Miniſters. As if ther were no difference betweene a priuate man of the baſeſt rout, &amp; a publique Miniſter at the hie Altar: And yet two or three years wages wil ſcarce ſerue to buy him books, &amp; bſides, of duty he ought to be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull &amp; intertainable to the needy.</p>
               <p>But now they ſay, that by this means it is well prouided for the ſubiects, who for the moſt part are but poore, &amp; liue hardly in theyr Villages: For how ſhould they maintain the Miniſter, who are themſelues to be maintained?</p>
               <p>Here in deed is the error of our age to be noted, which in ſome places giue to the ciuill Magiſtrate the goods of the Church, and permitteth them to gather vp tithes, which are due to the Miniſter. But to the purpoſe. In villages, the poor
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8306:127"/> which haue nothing, giue nothing, if it be litle which a man hath, he giueth litle: euery man payeth his tith according to his wealth, and according to the greatnes of his increaſe, whether the commodity lie in tillage, or in herbage. And in deed the poore could no waies better be prouided for, that they ſhould not relieue theyr Paſtors, themſelues being to be relieued, then thus; for by this means the Paſtors are maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned by them which haue much, &amp; they maintaine them which haue nothing. The increaſe of theyr fields, for the moſt part, keepe a certain ſcantline, &amp; euermore the number of them is greater, which receiue, then of the poore which want the ſame. But theſe their reaſons are too blame, that both poore &amp; Paſtors are ſo badly prouided for, as they are: for by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the goods, which are conſecrate to holy vſes, are betraied to prophane wretches, of whom themſelues muſt now goe beg their allowance, and be glad to ſerue and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in moſt ſlauiſh ſort for their iuſt reward.</p>
               <p>But yet again they argue, that men will ſeek occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Miniſter, when they ſhal ſee that they muſt giue often, &amp; ſhal hear their vices inueighed againſt; &amp; ſo wil fain cauſes with greater autority &amp; contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thruſt him out.</p>
               <p>But who ſeeth not here, how weakely this argument is grounded euen vppon an euil grounded gouernment of the Church, who leaue in the peoples hands, to place &amp; diſplace their Paſtors at their pleaſure; &amp; yet, if it ſo falleth out at any time (as it falleth out, ſo often as they fall out) the chriſtian Magiſtrat muſt be but an idle auditor in this iniury, &amp; haue no autority at all to compell the wicked in this caſe to theyr duty. But let <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of Rome an holy Martyr aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere this, who being deſtitute of the ayde of the chriſtian Magiſtrate, and being infeſted by <hi>Nouatus</hi> his faction ſo far forth, as that he was not far from giuing vp his hold, and yeelding to the wicked; yet did he euer want of thoſe his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>oblations,</hi> euen in the midſt of ſo much euil will, and ſo many diſſentions, ſo that he could not maintain therewith his 500. and 50. clerkes, and a 1000. 500. poore people? Neither were any of the Fathers, which liued of <hi>oblations,</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:8306:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> euer fearefull of the wicked, but were euer fearfull to the wicked, and were feared.</p>
               <p>Of no greater force is that which they ſay, that euil men being reprehended, wil giue nothing, but will rather ſuffer their Miniſter to famiſh for hunger. As if that were not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be feared leaſt it ſhould be done, (as we haue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the doing) by the Magiſtrat which payeth them wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when ſo euer a good Miniſter ſhal diſpleaſe a bad Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, But it ſeldome falleth out, that Paſtors haue only euil men in their pariſhes; the Lords flocke is mixt of good and bad. The good doe loue that which the wicked doe hate, whom to diſpleaſe is a great praiſe among good men; who will not ſuffer the faithful Miniſter to ſuffer loſſe for his wel doing, but will themſelues ſupply that, which they ſhall ſee wanting on the part of the wicked.</p>
               <p>But there is commonly alledged an other commodity of theſe ſtipends, namely this, for that the Miniſters may not ſeeme to take any thing of them of whom they ought not, as are the notorious vngodly, and noted Heretiques, with whom a man ought not to haue any thing to doe: as alſo of the good and godly, beeing poore and needy, to whome a man ought rather to giue: as are widows, orphans, the ſick and needy, whome to pill and pole is a point of cruell Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But I pray you, where doth the Magiſtate receaue, or of whome doth he contract thoſe things, by the which the Miniſters are paied their ſtipends? Of their owne goods, or out of the publique treaſurie? but is not that confuſedly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of the wicked togeather with the godly, of the poore together with the rich? This is indeed a ſtrange religion, that it ſhall not be lawfull for Paſtors to take of them, of whome the Magiſtrate taketh that he giueth them. All men pay ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie, and other tributes of the common-wealth, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſon, euery man according to the moity of hys ſubſtaunce: Of them which haue nothing, they take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>But this their religion is like vnto that of the <hi>Franciſcanes,</hi> who when they make great daintie to handle anye money
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:8306:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> with their proper fingers, they haue other to doe it for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I admit, it is a thing not beſeeming a godly Paſtor, to take of all commers: but as the voluntary oblations of wicked rich men are not to bee receaued, ſo the free offerings of godlie poor men are not to be refuſed (ſo that they exceed not the ability of the giuer) For although it be litle which is giuen, yet ſeeing it is the fruite of godlines, it ought neither to bee contemned of the Paſtor, nor yet ſuppreſſed in the faithfull. But bee it remembred, that I ſaid, the voluntary oblations of the wicked: for no doubt, a Miniſter of the Goſpel may take tythes euen of infidels alſo, if they be due to the Miniſter by the law and cuſtome of the Countrey: neither is religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more violated in ſo doing, then when the rents of farmes are paid, or receaued of husband-men our tenants, that are heretiques.</p>
               <p>As for the argument they drawe from the vaine oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the contributors, who becauſe they could not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, contention might ariſe among them, who ſhould exceed the reſt; it is an argument none at all: vnleſſe by the ſame reaſon, we will haue Chriſtians to abſtaine from good works, to auoyd oſtentation. But no man is to be diſwaded from bounteous beneficency, leaſt he ſhould fal into the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of vaine-glory. And that contention and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is good, when one man ſtriueth to excel another in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing: as for the hearts and minds of men, let vs leaue them for God to iudge.</p>
               <p>But their laſt argument is this, that there is no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that Miniſters of the Church ſhould be maintained by the oblations of the people: by the which it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it is not neceſſary that the ſame maner of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Miniſtery ſhould bee maintained alike in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and at all times: but that all things ought to be referred to good order, that they may be done to edification.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that albeit the Miniſter of the Church be not commanded to liue of the oblations of the people: (for hee may liue of his owne, and for certaine cauſes ſpare the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a time:) yet notwithſtanding, in the meane while the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8306:129"/> commaundement abideth, by the which the people are bound to honour their Paſtor, and by the liberall participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their goods, to teſtifie their gratefull &amp; godly deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towardes God, and him. Neither is the queſtion ſo much for the Miniſters maintenaunce, as for the godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards and grateful minds of the faithful towards God, who is alwaies moſt honored, or diſhonored in his ſeruants. For my part, I knowe not as yet the cuſtomes of all nations and countreys: Neither am I he, that will preſcribe to any man in this matter.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, I ſpeake of thoſe things which I haue learned by great vſe and long experience; and it greueth me, that in many things of like nature, wee aboliſh olde thinges, and ſuborne worſe. True it is, that pariſhes vnder the Pope, had their priuileges, their glebes, their rents and their tithes, by which their Paſtors were wel maintained; &amp; now, becauſe ſome abuſes be crept in, ſhall the whole vſe of them be taken away? Me thinks theſe are but cold reaſons I haue now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: with the which it were to be wondered, that any man ſhould bee caried away, were it not that the hatred of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie did hurry men headlong into vaine contrarieties in ſuch things as are, or haue bene vſed among them.</p>

               <p>Notwithſtanding, when I ſay, that Stipends taken out of the Exchequer, (or other-wiſe collected,) doe blaſt the fruites of religion, and depriue the people of the comforts thereof: I would not ſo bee taken, as if I thought it vnlawfull for the Magiſtrate to contribute out of the treaſury to the Church: But this I ſay, that the Chriſtian people ought not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding continually to be deuoted vnto their Paſtors, in the bonds of a religious affinity, and religiouſly to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Miniſters with the teſtimonies of their gratefull memory: the which when it is hindred by the one part, it muſt needs be, that charity ſhould waxe very colde on both parts.</p>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8306:130"/> not accuſtomed to paſſe any thing to their Paſtors, wil think it perteines nothing to them wheather they ſincke or ſwim: and moſt men are of that booriſh nature, as that they wil ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaue the Paſtor deſtitute, then they wil ſeem to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute: and ſo, hee being forſaken of his flocke, of force muſt needs forſake his flocke, (as at this day it is come to paſſe in many places of <hi>Holland.</hi>)</p>
               <p>But how wretched the eſtate of the Miniſtery is in that countrey, by reaſon of the baſenes of their ſtipends, and the badnes of their paiments, they knowe beſt that ſmart for it: when as (poore ſoules) they are conſtrained to trudge no ſmall iorneis to begge their wages of their good maiſters: of whome many times, they beeing intertained with diſdaine, are ſent away with a miſchief, and bring nothing home with them but night, (beſides the wearines of their lims, the loſſe of their time, the expence of their money, and anguiſhe of their relenting ſoules.)</p>
               <p>To theſe miſeries we may adde this alſo, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, accuſtomed to pay the Miniſters their wages out of the common treaſury, beginneth to take them for ciuill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and towne-ſeruants: ſo that baſe men will not ſticke ſome-times, after they are once out of office, (as Curriers, Tinkers, Carpenters, Pedlers, and ſuch like) to inſult ouer their Paſtors with a villanous mind, and in a ſhameleſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to ſay, What, ſir-prieſts? you are our ſeruants, we are your good maiſters, we pay you wages: I would be aſhamed (ſo God mee helpe) ſo diſdainefully to ſhake vp the verieſt page or baſeſt drudge in my Lordes kitchin, and as ſoone I ſhould be called to mine anſwere for it.</p>
               <p>I remember, in a ſolemne banquet made at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> it was my hap to ſit ouer againſt a cople of iolly Burgo-maiſters: who when they once began to be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what warme in their liquor, and were now come from neuer a word, to neuer a wiſe word; at laſt they ſpied me buſie in talke with another, and thinking I marked not what they ſaid, they began to ſpeake their pleaſure, and by chance I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard thus much of their good talk. We muſt take heed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:8306:130"/> (ſaid they) leaſt theſe buſie Miniſters becom more comber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto vs, then were euer our corne-fed Papiſts: we muſt therfore keepe them vnder leaſt they grow too luſtie, &amp; creep too far in fauor with the people, and ſo become a terrour to the Magiſtrates: but eſpecially we muſt looke to this, that their wages be not too great: <hi>Hee that bringeth vp his ſeruant delicately, at length ſhall find him maister-full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe men (a Gods name) would ſeeme the patrons and pillers of Chriſt his Church: but they (bee it ſpoken without any preiudice to any other) did afterwards bewray the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome they foſtered in their harts, when not long after they both became traytors to God and their country. Whether <hi>Holland</hi> harbour any more ſuch mates, let them looke to it vnto whom it belongeth: but the like effects giue a ſhrewd geſſe of the like affects. In the meane while wee ſee, how this diſdainefull dealing againſt Gods Miniſters commeth of this, becauſe they are ſo bragge that they pay them their ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; being indeed no other thing, then that which they haue before purloined fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church, &amp; crambd into their guiltie coffers. Wherefore, let no man wonder, if I like but a little of this manner honoring of the Miniſterie: for ſmal is the honor that is braued with contumely. And therefore in the name of God, let that manner of honoring Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters bee continued in the Church, which was appointed by the better wiſedome of the Lord, aſwell in the olde, as in the new Teſtament, I ſay let it be continued in that manner as it was well conceiued, and worthily receiued by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers: Neither let the prerogatiue of our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits any longer deceiue vs, as if we were the onely men that could deuiſe a better. Let abuſes bee corrected; but ſo, that the lawful vſe be either retained, or reſtored. Nor let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie of thoſe men which haue defiled thinges ſacred and prophane, ſo farre preuaile with vs, that wee ſhould therefore confound things ſecular and ſacred, or that wee ſhould take away that diſtinction in things, which nature, reaſon, and religion hath ſet downe.</p>

No doubt, as to ſtand vpon the examples of our Fathers in their offences, is fooliſh and vnreaſonable; ſo raſhly to condemne the ſame where iuſtly they cannot bee conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is vtterly godleſſe and irreligious.</p>
               <p>True it is: wee are all prone to euill, Fathers, and Fathers children; but to whether of theſe may wee bee more eaſely perſwaded, iudge you: to giue of our owne, or to take away other mens? Our Elders gaue, (which no man can denie) of no euill mind: our vpſtarts take away that our Elders gaue;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:8306:131"/> with what mind, the thing it ſelfe doth ſhew. Our Fathers gaue according to law: our nouices take away contrarie to law. Wherfore ſeeing the indowments made to the Church haue their ſtrength and aſſurance from the very ſame lawes, by the which other Citizens poſſeſſe their goods, is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man that would not iudge it a tyrannous act, if any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate (ſhewing no cauſe) ſhould thruſt any ſubiect out of his poſſeſsions?</p>
               <p>Wherfore, the Churchmen ought to haue bene firſt heard, and iuſt cauſe ſhould haue beene brought in againſt them, why they were not any longer to bee ſuffered to enioy the poſſeſsions of the Church in a Chriſtian common-wealth. They alſo ought to haue bene heard which were to ſucceed the Maſſe-Prieſtes in paſtorall charge, whome it chiefly did concerne what was to be done with thoſe goods. But what need all this? without any iuſt knowledge, or further trial of the cauſe, a quicke courſe muſt be taken; &amp; the Chequer (if it were the Chequer) ſwopt at al. But if the Church-men were found ready to renounce all Popery, and to receiue the true profeſsion of Chriſt his religion what cauſe was there lefte, or what occaſion might be found, why Biſhops and Paſtors ſhould be expelled their pariſhes &amp; poſſeſsions? vnleſſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did reckon the Church goods among the other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies? which error is already confuted. But where now ſhall I lay the blame? vpon the ignorance of the Miniſters? or the auarice of certaine Officers? No doubt, they were both in great fault. But certaine craftie &amp; vngodly men, who not in the zeal of godlines, but for the deſire of goods (preſuming of a pardon for the contempt of all religion) ioyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto vs; and while they would ſeem the more ſerious fauorites of the Goſpell they became the moſt ſacrilegious inſtrumentes of this miſchiefe: ſo that the ſame which of ſom was thought to be done of error or ignorance, in theſe was brought to paſſe of a malitious wickednes. For who can excuſe them of moſt hainous ſacrilege, who vnder colour of reformation in ſome partes of Germany, &amp; the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, haue made a pray of whatſoeuer was giuen for holy &amp;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:8306:132"/> neceſſary vſes, to the Church and Church Miniſters? With due reuerence I acknowledge the chiefe Magiſtrates, as the chiefe patrons of religion: and I hold it alwayes lawfull for them, according to their royal right, to make lawes for the Church and Church goodes; alwayes prouided, that they ſo take not the matter vpon themſelues, that they take al vnto themſelues. For it is not the part of a patron to ſpoile his clyent; neither was it euer heard of, before theſe dayes, that any Chriſtian Magiſtrate brought into his Chequer all the Church goods, &amp; made no bones therof. They which vpon occaſion rifled the Church, onely of ſome ſmall part therof, &amp; that when the Chequer was in ſome great conſumption, are but euil ſpoken of for their labour in all hiſtories. What then may we iudge of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who haue ſet the cards, &amp; drawne the Church of euery penny? I name none; But I mean them, who by their example haue giuen the hint to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and ſet them a patterne of an holy robbery. Lord, how like are theſe ranke profeſſors to <hi>Iulian</hi> the recreant, or the Turkiſh tyrant, which make no difference betweene thinges ſacred &amp; prophene? how vnlike to any Chriſtian Magiſtrate, (ſo far as I know) either of this age, or our fore-fathers?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are ſome found now adaies (not far to ſeek) who thinke that no ſacrilege can now bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe the, difference betwene ſacred &amp; prophane in externe thinges, was taken away by the death of our Sauiour; which ſeemeth to mee not the iudgement of a Diuine, but the opinion of an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt. For albeit to the holy all things are holy, and to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane all things prophane; yet that diſtinction of things is not taken away, which they haue in their appointed vſe. There was alwayes among all nations a great difference put,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8306:132"/> betweene thoſe thinges which were dedicated vnto diuine ſeruice, and thoſe thinges which ſerue men for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſes. Thinges for the moſt part take their denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their ende for the which they were ordained. So priuate men haue their treaſure; and the common-wealth her treaſure: If you doe reſpect the matter, they are both of one nature; namely, gold and ſiluer, and whatſoeuer elſe is of any price: but if you reſpect either the end, or the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, you ſhall finde a great difference betweene them. The end of a priuate man his treaſurie, is the commoditie of a familie; but the end of the publike treaſure, is the benefite of the Prince and the whole Country. In like manner the treaſure which is giuen or gatheted to the worſhip of God, it hath his proper end, diuerſe and diſtinct from both thoſe before mentioned: the which ende ſeeing it is ſacred, it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the name alſo to the treaſure, and it is called <hi>ſacred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, becauſe the inuiry is greater which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt a Prince, or a publike ſtate, then if the ſame be done againſt a priuate mans perſon, or his eſtate; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the robbing of a priuate treaſure, is called plain Theft; but of the common treaſure, a Robbery of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welth. So likewiſe how much the more horrible the offence is which is committed againſt God, then againſt man, ſo much more deteſtable is the direption of the ſacred treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then common theft, or the robbing of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie. For which cauſe they call that alſo by his proper name <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> which is commonly defined, to bee the theft of a thing ſacred. The deformitie of which theft is ſo much the more notorious, by how much the more ſharper puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God himſelf, as alſo the laws of al nations haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the ſame. Albeit the definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things ſacred to the worſhip of the true God, but of falſe gods alſo: for that it is the conſcience that maketh the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, &amp; an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy godhead contemned. But how all thoſe goods the Romiſh Cleargie did poſſeſſe (vnder the title of the poore, &amp; the Church) haue beene tranſlated to priuat &amp; prophane vſes, I need not tel, for it is too manifeſt.</p>

That the goods of the Church did ſerue to Idolatry, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane vſes, the which beeing taken away, they could by lawe deuolue no man, but onely to the common treaſury, of the which the Chriſtian Magiſtrate hath the care and cuſtodie.

But that waſt goods pertaine to the common treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by way of excheate, it is a knowne point in the lawe, and a common caſe.</p>
               <p>Neyther were the Biſhops of olde of this opinion, that the Church had nay right to thoſe goods which were deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vnto the ſeruice of Idols: ſo that it may ſeeme a verie ſtraunge thing to vs, that at this day there ſhould be found any faithfull Miniſter of the Goſpel, which ſhould once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to make chalenge to the goods of the Popiſh Church, to the vſe and behalfe of reformed Churches.

But to admitte the vtmoſt, that the Cleargie would haue raked together their wealth, to the ruine of the Common-wealth; and that of olde, donations were made, partly ſuperſtitious, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuperfluous; yet of all this it followeth not, that there were none lawfull, none religious, none acceptable vnto GOD, and a greeable vnto his worde, and profitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church.

Craftie men abuſed the preaching of the Goſpell, and the ſimplicitie of godlie men (whome it was eaſie to hold ſo in hand) that ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues might gourmandize the goods of the Church, as a fat pray that hung fit for their lips. That it was ſo, the thing it ſelfe preacheth vnto vs. Neyther will I any longer ſtay ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, leaſt this ſinke beeing ſtirred, ſhould exhale a vapour too filthie and vnſauorie.</p>
               <p>But that which is aleged for the defence of ſacrilege, may not ſo paſſe, vnexamined. The firſt is, That the church goods ſerued
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:8306:134"/> to idolatrous &amp; prophane vſes: which being taken away, could by no lawe deuolue to any but to the publike treaſury. Now that the fallacie of this propoſition may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: I aſſume that to me which themſelues cannot deny me, namely, that there is a difference to be found betweene thoſe thinges which are <hi>dedicated</hi> to idolatry and exceſſe, and thoſe thinges which are <hi>abuſed</hi> to idolatry and exceſſe. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo holy which the wicked may not abuſe: and yet the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of a good thing dooth not inuert the nature thereof. As for the welth of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Cleargy, it was not all giuen to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous and vngodly vſes: for there were many thinges giuen of old, to the vſe of the poore, and Paſtors of the Church. The which albeit the Popiſh Cleargy haue abuſed, yet the nature of the donation is not thereby altered. Of the donations which were made to Churches, <hi>ſome</hi> were before the corruption of the Church, and <hi>ſome</hi> after. (For I ſhewed before, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and donations of the faithfull, had their beginning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the Apoſtles.) But that theſe, which were made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the corruption, are ſacred to God, no godly man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the ſame. Now, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and other heretical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, found the churches founded by the Apoſtles, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed (according to thoſe times) with ſufficient riches: to the which, albeit they added much by much naughtines, yet the ſame is not to be eſteemed of alike, but ſo to bee accounted of as the reſt was. No queſtion, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other heretique Churches, there are diuerſe and ſundry thinges, the which if they be taken in their proper kind, are very chriſtian, and commaunded by God himſelfe: (ſuch is the ſacred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Church, &amp; holy care of the poore:) So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was bequeathed to either of theſe, or vnto them both, hath a godly end, and may haue a godly vſe. As for the <hi>propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of things, it ought not ſo much to mooue vs, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things: againſt the which there is no litle to be gained, ether by preſcription of time, or abuſe of the thing. But if it ſo fall out, that the prophane vſe be aboliſhed, they ought to be reuerſed vnto their lawful vſe, for the which they firſt ſerued. The Arke of the Lord was taken of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but it did not therefore ceaſe to be ſacred to God, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8306:135"/> receiued againe from the <hi>Philistines,</hi> it was no leſſe to be eſteemed, then it was before.

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> A diſtinction of thoſe Church-goods, which the Church of Rome poſſeſſeth at this day.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt when as all the goods which we ſee in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not of the ſame kind, we cannot giue the ſame iudgement of them al. There is therfore a thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold difference of them alwaies to be remembred: In the firſt order I place thoſe, which our godly Fathers gaue to the Church, for the maintenance of the Paſtors, and the relief of the poore. In the ſecond order I place thoſe, which were granted to the church for ſuperſtitious vſes; as for Maſſes, Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Monks and Nuns, &amp; morow Maſſe-prieſts. And in the laſt order I place thoſe infinite donations, pernitious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-welth, which were either raſhly made by Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, or wrongfully extorted from them, by force or fraud: of which kinde are the inueſtiture of thoſe Eccleſiaſticall fees, which were giuen by godly Princes to the churches; the which when as by that title they do pertaine to them of right; yet the BB. of <hi>Rome</hi> doth chalenge the whole right therof to himſelfe But theſe things, ſeeing that by the lawes both of God &amp; man, they pertain to Kings alone, that which is <hi>Caeſars</hi> is to be giuen to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> The Lord hath forbidden miniſters to be Kings ouer
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8306:135"/> their churches: &amp; therefore, in the 22. of <hi>Luke,</hi> he purgeth that humor in the heads of his Apoſtles with this Aloes. <hi>The Kings of nations rule ouer them, and they which haue power ouer them are cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led bountifull, but it ſhall not be ſo with you:</hi> that is, you ſhall not be Kings: with which magnificent titles of bountifull and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they flatter them which haue ſmal cauſe, bearing the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy yoke of their cruell dominion. Wherefore in this caſe, chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings may lawefully reuerſe, what-ſoeuer the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath vnlawfully raked to himſelfe, by fraud or by force.</p>
               <p>But heere I require diſcretion and moderation to bee vſed, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> do not ſo reuerſe thoſe things which are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> that together he fal to rifle thoſe things which are <hi>Gods.</hi> Indeed the cleargy of <hi>Rome</hi> hath rauiſht them both; but they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy whom the chriſtian Magiſtrat ſhuld imitate: neither is he a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of worth, that wil puniſh theft with ſacrilege. What things the error of our fathers gaue to ſuperſtitious vſes, they ar void I confeſſe, (ſupeſtition and idolatry being taken away,) &amp; the godly Magiſtrat may diſpoſe of ſuch goods, as hee ſhall thinke good: neither hath the church any right to chalenge in theſe. And yet, if the authority of the former law aleadged, and the counſel of the learned father <hi>Auguſtine</hi> be of any worth, thoſe legacies which were giuen for the celebrating of maſſes, &amp; the nouriſhing of Monks may be conuerted to ſome better vſe, by the which, the memory of the teſtator may be ſolemnized in another &amp; a more lawful kind. In the 16. of <hi>Numb.</hi> the cenſors with the which, the 250. rebels offered vp incenſe, as Prieſts in ſin &amp; vngodlines, were notwithſtanding <hi>hallowed</hi> before God: and therfore, that in no wiſe they might afterwards be imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any common vſes, he commanded them to be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to brode plates for a couering to the altar. So were the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the irreligious abuſed conuerted to a ſacred and a religious vſe. The which commandement indeed, althogh it be not general, yet it conteineth therein an eſpeciall inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the which we are taught, what ought to be done in ſuch a caſe. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 154. Epiſtle to <hi>Publicola,</hi> is of opinion, that the Idols, Idol-temples, &amp; groues which were put down, were not to be diuerted to any priuate vſe, but to bee conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into publike ſeruices, and the honor of the true God; that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8306:136"/> the like thing may be done by them, which is done in the men themſelues, who are conuerted from a ſacrilegious &amp; impious people, to the true religion of the liuing God: Leaſt otherwiſe it might ſeem to be done, not of conſcience, but for couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But ſeing the law of God preſcribeth nothing in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and whatſoeuer <hi>Moſes</hi> hath written therof, concerneth the people of <hi>Iſraell</hi> in perticular, I make it no matter of religion why the Magiſtrate may not determine herein as it ſhal ſeeme beſt to his godly wiſedome. Nor doe I diſauow the decree of the Emperours <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> but I aduiſe al Princes and other chiefe Magiſtrates, who haue earſt reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or ſhall here-after, that this one thing be alwais wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of them, namely, that Churches were but robbed of their rights by Moneſtaries, when they gleaned to themſelues the duty of tythes and oblations: which things chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and people haue conſecrated of old, to the honor of their Paſtors, &amp; the comfort of the poore. For they prepoſterouſlie take vpon them the gouernement of Churches, contrary vnto the order of the ancient Church, and vnder the title of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary pouerty, theſe gathered that to themſelues, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the poore for neceſſity.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in thoſe goods which the <hi>Pastors</hi> and rectors of the Church poſſeſſe, I haue ſhewed that ther is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: ſo neither are we to think, that the goods of <hi>Monks</hi> are all of one ſort. It were to long to repeat, how they came to ſo great wealth, neither is it needfull; onely this I wuld haue wel noted, that whatſoeuer the <hi>Monks</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which of right was due to the Paſtors of the church, that al that did pertaine to the firſt order of church-goods (which I before noted:) the which indeed after the ſubuerſion of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries are not to be taken for waſt, ſo long as there is anie Church remaining. Wherevpon I infer, that all popiſh idolatrie being put down, onely thoſe things which maintained, either tyranny, or idolatry, do deuolue by right to the Chequer: the reſt, which had nor cauſe nor end erronious, was to be teſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Church againe.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:8306:136"/>
               <p>If ſo be in any place, all is come to the common treaſury, whatſoeuer the <hi>Monkiſh</hi> profeſſors had in poſſeſſion, and that, not ſo much with the conſent, as by the counſel of thoſe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter it ſelfe did concerne, and ought rather to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſed, and taught the Magiſtrate the contrary, let them beare the blame for that part themſelues, worthy alſo to bear the burthen. We know that the prophanation and abuſe of Church goods could not be ſuch, as that they could inuert the nature of things giuen, or infring the vertue of the donation it ſelfe. That which the Arke of God was, was it not ſtill, euen among the Philiſtines? Neyther were the veſſels of the Lorde his Temple vnhallowed, though they were in the midſt of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon. That the Pope of Rome with his clergy haue abuſed, and doe abuſe the true and lawfull goods of the Church, it ought not to be any preiudice to the godly Miniſters of the Church: Seeing the poſſeſſors thereof are not Lords, but ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards onely, who haue the vſe, benefite, and beſtowing of the Church goods, not the propriety.</p>
               <p>As for that they ſay, that the Biſhops of old thought, that the Church had no right to thoſe things which were dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſeruice of the Heathen gods: it maketh nothing at all againſt the truth of our poſition: For neyther do we hold, that the Church hath any right to thoſe things which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly deſtinate to vngodly vſes: I haue already confeſſed, that thoſe things are in the ſecond order of Church goods: &amp; therfore in the power and at the pleaſure of the chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat. I remember that I ſayd, that I did not diſlike the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and other godly Emperours: whoſe better examples, if they had imitated, whoſe error hath vrged me to write thus much, there had beene no neede of this diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oreouer this alſo is not to bee omitted, that it is one thing for a people to be conuerted from <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme</hi> to Chriſtianity, and an other thing to come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:8306:137"/> 
                  <hi>Popery,</hi> that is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hereſie to true Chriſtianity. The difference which is between Paganiſme and Chriſtianity is much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then that which is betweene Chriſtianity &amp; Popery. Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme hath nothing in common with Chriſtianity: Popery is Chriſtianity, Chriſtianity alayed; alaied, or rather rackt with foule Idolatry, and (that I may ſo ſpeake) it is a certayne med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, or a kinde of mongrel and motley Chriſtianity. For the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture both of the old and new Teſtament, the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, the Baptiſme of Chriſt, the remiſſion of ſins, and the name of a chriſtian, with many other things of the ſame profeſſion are there, peculiar to the Church, which are notes of chriſtianity, &amp; are no wher to be found out of the Church: Not in Paganiſme, not in Iudaiſme, not in Nahumetiſme. So that the Hereſies &amp; Superſtition which being ſubſtracted, are added to the Romiſh Church, the remainder is meere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. Very Popery is but a botch of the Church, not the very Church: but that which the foule Leproſy is, or any other deadly contagion in the body of man, the ſame is Popery in the body of the Church. So that, to forſake Popery is not to forſake the Church, but to fly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the infection of the church. Now then; when an Ethnicke becommeth a Chriſtian; an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyen and a ſtraunger, is receyued and inſerted into the newe people, &amp; then beginneth he to be a member of the Church. But in the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any erronious or ſtragling Church, an adulterous Church becommeth a chaſt ſpouſe, and baſe chriſtians are made lawfull, (the wife being reconciled to her huſband:) and therefore, what things ſo euer the adulterous Church vſurped of the goods of her huſband, the lawfull Church (as true ſpouſe) doth challenge the ſame to her ſelfe by his right. In <hi>Theodoſius Records</hi> the ſixteenth Book and the foure and forty title, againſt the <hi>Donatiſtes,</hi> thus it goeth. <hi>But thoſe places, in the which curſed ſuperstition as yet remayneth, let them be ioyned to the holy Catholique Church, ſo that theyr Flamines and Prieſts, theyr Prelates and all theyr Ministers, be ſpoyled of all theyr goods, and exiled into diuerſe Iles and ſundry prouinces.</hi> There alſo in the fourth Booke, we reade of a decree from the ſame Emperours <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> againſt the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> in theſe wordes. <hi>If there now remayneth any proper edifices, which
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8306:137"/> ought to bee called rather dens then Churches, let them bee awarded to the holy Churches of the Orthodoctike ſect, with all theyr indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before our times there haue beene not a fewe alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Church. In the which when godly Emperours put downe the Heretikes, they robbed not the Churches of theyr poſſeſſions, but reſtored them to the true profeſſors. Of the which thing Sainct <hi>Auſtine</hi> in his fifty Epiſtle to <hi>Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> a certayne Capitayne, writeth thus. <hi>VVhat ſo euer was poſſeſſed of the Donatistes parte in the name of theyr Churches, chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperours by their religious lawes haue commuanded, that they come with the Churches them ſelues to the catholicke Church.</hi> Thus ſayth <hi>Auſtine:</hi> And were it not as he ſayth, I would confirme the ſame with many witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, that I may now compriſe thoſe thinges I haue ſayd: Thoſe Church goods which were gotten, eyther by fraude or by force, and vſurped without right; or elſe if they were freely giuen, but to a ſuperſtitious end, are in the power of the chiefe Magiſtrate. But thoſe thinges which are lawfully graunted and receyued of the Church, (to no ſuch end, by no ſuch meanes) are conſecrate to GOD, neyther can they bee any wayes tranſuerſed without ſinfull Sacrilege. Sainct <hi>Auſtine,</hi> in his Treatiſe vppon Sainct <hi>Iohn</hi> the twelfth Chapter. Behold <hi>Iudas (ſayth hee)</hi> is among the holy men, and that you ſhall not need to contemne him, a Sacrilegious Church-robber, not a petty Laſſoner: hee was a thiefe of the Treſure, but the Lordes Treaſure; of the Treaſure, but the ſacred Treaſure. And if crimes are diſtinguiſhed in the Court, whether it be theft, or publique robbery, (for publique rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery is ſayd to be a theft from the common Treaſury) howe much more ſharpely is a Sacriligious thiefe to bee iudged, which preſumeth to ſteale, not from euery place, but from the holy Church?

And therefore he exhorteth thoſe, vppon whome this deadly deſire groweth, that they would vſe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the ſame, and humbly to fly to the Temple of the Gods; to frequent the company of good men, to heare theyr godly conference, and to endeuour themſelues to doe and to ſpeake thoſe things which are honeſt and iuſt. But if ſo be, that infirmity wil not ſo depart, death for ſuch a wretch were better then life. Wherefore he enacteth this Law. <hi>VVhoſoeuer is aprehended for Sacrilege,</hi>

                  <hi>(if hee be a ſeruant, or a foreyner) his fault being written in his forehead, and his handes, and being well whipped with ſo many ſtripes as the Iudge ſhall award, let him bee thruſt naked out of the borders of the land: For happely by this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being brought to ſhame, he may amend his manners.

But if it be a Cittizen which ſhall be found to haue commited any ſuch thing againſt the Gods, or to haue done ſome great and graceleſſe wrong to his parentes, or his countrey, let the iudge ſo cenſure of him, as of one which is incurable, conſidering this with himſelfe, what honeſt inſtruction and education he hath had of a childe, and yet hath not abſteyned from the moſt hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinnes.

But the wrath of God found the ſot in the deede doing, &amp; brought him in a ſharp reckoning, with an heauy vp ſhot in the miraculous motion of a hand writing. And here <hi>Daniel</hi> cald before the king to read &amp; expound the heauenly
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:8306:139"/> drawn writ, in ſtead of a taking away, taketh him vp, &amp; amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many other things bordeth him thus. <hi>Thou haſt lift vp thy ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lord of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they haue broght the veſſels of his houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, &amp; thou &amp; thy Princes, thy wiues &amp; thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubins haue dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k wine in them, &amp; thou haſt praiſed the Gods of ſiluer and gold, of bras, iron, wood, &amp; ſtone, which neither ſee, neither hear nor vnderſtand, &amp; the God in whoſe ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thy breath is and al thy waies, him haſt thou not glorified: Then was the palm of the hand ſent from him, &amp; hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this writing. MENE, MENE, THEKEL, VPHARSIN. This is the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpeach: MENE, God hath nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, &amp; hath finiſhed it. THEKEL, thou art weighed in the balance, &amp; thou art fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d too light. VPHARSIN, thy kingdom is deuided, &amp; it is giuen to the Meeds &amp; Perſians.</hi> After this maner did <hi>Daniel</hi> ſalute him. But the ſame night was <hi>Balthazar</hi> ſlaine, &amp; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Chaldees and <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which continued an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty yeares, was now finiſhed, and theruppon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away by God to the <hi>Meedes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I paſſe on to the time of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> vnder whom the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſuffred much ſorrow, as wel by their own nation, as by the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the reſt the diueliſh enterpriſe of <hi>Alſimus</hi> hie prieſt of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> attempting the ouerthrow of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was not left vnpuniſhed: For hee was ſtrooke with a dead Palſy, &amp; ended his life in great miſery. In like manner <hi>Heliodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> ſent by king <hi>Seleucus</hi> to Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for no other end, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ranſanck the temple (which he vnderſtood to be the guardian of great treaſure) felt in himſelf the reuenging hand of God, neither had he eſcaped preſent death, had not <hi>Onias</hi> the Prieſt interceſſed for him. But he being glad he had ſo eſcaped, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to the king. <hi>That God was the ouerſeer of that temple, &amp; the great guard of that treaſury: yet notwithſtanding, if the king had any man he would gladly do a ſpite, he might ſend him thither.</hi> The rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of that Temple, coſt <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi> Romaine Emperour ful dear. Did not God reuenge his Sacrilege by his enemies the <hi>Perſians?</hi> They infuſed molten gold into his head being dead, becauſe hee thirſted after ill gotten good in his life. But <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traytour is worthy to haue the firſt place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong this holy rabble: Whoſe Sacrilegious couetouſneſſe bread ſuch a monſter in his breſt, that for baſe lucre he ſpared
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8306:140"/> not his own Maiſter, his conſcience euer yelling, <hi>that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied the innocent.</hi> Wherefore afterwards, he being his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, and iudge, &amp; tormentor, ſet down his due puniſhment, and in deſperate manner tooke it of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Much of this making were that holy couple <hi>Ananias</hi> &amp; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyra,</hi> whom God tooke in the manner, and took down with ſuddaine death, onely for that they aduentured to conceale &amp; keepe backe ſome part of that theyr owne treaſure, which them ſelues of theyr owne accord had dedicated to the Lord. The fact no doubt might better haue beene excuſed in theyr own, then in another mans treaſure, and yet wee ſee the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cenſure of God in this caſe, to the terror of all other.</p>
               <p>How <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour was paied home at the laſt, as wel for his Sacrilege, as his Apoſtacy, the fame of al hiſtories hath made a iuſt record. This is he, that in a mockery of Chriſt and chriſtianity, when he had libde the Church, and left it neuer a good thing, ſayd: He had well prouided of theyr ſouls health: For to be poore is one of the priuy Counſels of the Goſpell. I may ioyne with this <hi>Iulian, Iulian</hi> his Vncle, one caterpiller with an other. This Gentleman, when he had well ranſackt the Church, and raked together theyr moſt precious veſſels &amp; ſumptuous Monuments at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and had caſt them vppon the ground all vppon one heape, he began very game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely to play vppon Chriſt, and to wanton at his pleaſure; &amp; to increaſe the diſgrace of that holy ſpoyle of the Church, at laſt he vncaſed his poſtherne parts, and ſat him downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſame: But now, ſee if God could ſee the ſame, and not reuenge it? Nay; but preſently thereuppon, his priuy diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful parts, and thoſe poores which nature had ther placed for neceſſary vſes, were ſtraungely benummed, in ſo much that the canckred fleſh about thoſe vnſeemly parts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified and turned into wormes; but laſt of all, the vgly diſeaſe grew on ſo far, that it paſſed far the Art of Phiſicke. For the greedy vermine, hauing once entred the inner partes, ſtill ſcrawled to the quicke and ſound fleſh, nor imight they euer ceaſe their reſtleſſe gnawing, till he had yelled out his curſed ſoule.</p>
               <p>Many more inſtances might be remembred of chriſtian
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8306:140"/> Princes, were it not to tedious a thing for me to repeat them: as alſo, for that there are ſome things regeſtred for wicked ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crileges, which if they had bin done without the contempt of God, might very well haue bene excuſed. For no doubt, it had bin ſacrilege in <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee eat the <hi>Shewbread,</hi> were it not that neceſſity did excuſe it. And therefore, ſacrilege is to bee meaſured according to the mans irreligion, which is bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſwell in the contempt of falſe Gods, as the neglect of true: namely, whenſoeuer that is contemned by vs, which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by other men, and we do it not of any true deuotion towardes God, but of a certaine irreligion in our ſelues. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo greatlye is it to bee regarded, with what minde a thing bee done, as that to deſtroy the groues and temples of falſe Gods, of a certaine religion towardes the true God, is to be accounted for great godlines in the true worſhippers: The ſame thing, if it be done of the worſhippers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of falſe Gods, or of ſome other Atheiſt and contemner of al the gods, it is to be taken for godles impiety, and wretched ſacrilege.</p>
               <p>If any man aske the queſtion, how he ſhould be ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne God, that thinketh there is no God: I aunſwere, that that onely thing it ſelfe, <hi>that he thinketh there is none,</hi> procedeth of a contempt, &amp; ſo conſequently of him which is. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it need not ſeeme ſtraunge to any man, that the wrath of the true God hath bene ſo inraged, not onely againſt ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious idolatours, but euen in the ſacrilege of idol Gods. Of which iudgement, ſeeing prophane hiſtories affoord vs infinit copie, we will take view of a few of that company. Nor <hi>Brennus</hi> nor <hi>Xerxes</hi> could violate the temple of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and not taſte the cuppe of gods vengeance for it. As for the ſacrilege of the <hi>Tholoſian gold</hi> (from whence the adage grew) I ſhal not need to ſpeake of it beeing ſo generally knowen. But the ſouldiers of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> ſent to ſpoile the Temple of <hi>Ammon,</hi> were ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med quicke in vengeable heapes of heauy ſand: and their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a ſcorner of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> religion, albeit ſuperſtitious: yet becauſe he did it irreligiouſly; not long after he had ſlaine <hi>Apus,</hi> was ſlaine himſelfe by his owne ſword. And how preſent was the vengeance of God in the reuenge of <hi>Pyrrhus?</hi> Hee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſht at his pleaſure the <hi>Lucreſian Proſerpina:</hi> but when he wold
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:8306:141"/> haue ſailed away full fraught with his nefarious pray, he wrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with his whole nauy vpon the next ſhore: there was he left to the rage of the ſeas, but the treaſure was found, &amp; brought home to the Goddeſſe. To theſe I adde the like example (but the eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnlike) of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Syracuſan</hi> tirant. It is the rather to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred for their ſakes, whoſe greteſt ſport amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their ſecret co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue made a pray of the church, to play vpon God, as if they would laugh him but of heauen, for his loſſe in the church. This <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> as I ſuppoſe, hath ſet vp ſchoole among our religious Atheiſts of theſe daies. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you haue here the words of <hi>Tully</hi> concerning this <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> as they are ſet downe by <hi>Valerius maximus. Dionyſius borne at</hi> Syracuſa, <hi>counted it in part of his greatest ſport, to ſet forth with gibing termes, his ſo many ſacrileges as we now repeat. For hauing ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked the temple of</hi> Proſerpina <hi>at</hi> Locris, <hi>when he had paſsed the ſeas with a proſperous gale, geering to his followers, doe you ſee (ſaith hee) how fortunate a cut thoſe very Gods haue giuen vs, whom we haue rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed? Hauing taken away from the</hi> Olympian Iupiter <hi>a golden veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great waight, with the which King</hi> Hiero <hi>had honored him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the</hi> Carthagenian <hi>Gods, and hauing caſt him into a new liuery of Mockado, he ſaid; that a golden coat was to heauy for ſommer, and to colde for winter, but his Lincie-wolſie would fit him for both ſeaſons. The ſame alſo at</hi> Epidaurus, <hi>commaunded</hi> Aeſculapius <hi>his golden beard to be barbd, becauſe</hi> (as hee ſaid) <hi>it was not fit that</hi> Apollo <hi>his father ſhould be beardleſſe, and he thus ouer-barbed. Moreouer he ſeaſed vpon their ſiluer and golden tables in the Temples, and whereas according to the cuſtome of</hi> Greece, <hi>it was written vpon them,</hi> Theſe are the good Gods, <hi>he ſaid, hee was very well content to accept the goodnes of the Gods. Againe, hee tooke away the golden wreathes, and boles, and garlands, which were helde out at armes end by the images, and in ſo doing, hee ſaid, he did receaue them, not deceaue them: ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, that it were a meere folly, ſeeing that we aske good things of the Gods, not to take them, when they proffer them. But this man, albeit hee was not puniſhed, as hee deſerued, yet when as hee died, for verie ſhame of his vntowarde ſonne, hee receaued that puniſhment by his death, which hee eſcaped in his life. For the wrath of God proceedeth but an eaſie paſe to reuenge himſelfe: but in the end hee requiteth the ſlownes of his patience, with the ſharpnes of their puniſhments.</hi>

               <p>Thus farre goeth <hi>Valerius:</hi> who albeit he ſay ſome-what, yet that is much more which the ſame <hi>Tullie</hi> noted: namely, that tyrants are ſtoong with a continuall diſquiet of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the villanies they haue committed neuer ſuffering them to reſt, but wringing their minds with inceſſant torture, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-wiſe then a hang man doth a condemned perſon. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Dionyſius</hi> laghters in ſo many ſacrileges were but ſo many girnings: neither could hee, being condemned in himſelfe of ſo many miſdeeds, be without a miſerable and mangled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. I ſuppoſe, in the opinion of men, he might outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſeeme a happy man, but yet within, he knew himſelfe how wretched he was, and hee felt the ſame. For this cauſe he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Damocles</hi> to make iuſt triall thereof, (beeing deſirous to trie) he ſat him down in a golden throne, inuironed of al ſides with a conſort of well tuned pleaſures, euery note prouoking him to a ſweet reliſhe of this deſired happines: But when hee perceiued a glittering ſword hang ouer his head, ſtrong with a ſlender haire point de-uice: his heart was done, and all the ſport was daſht: <hi>Damocles</hi> ſware, he would no more be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, deſiring the Tyraunt to forgiue him his felicitie. But how much more tortured were the braines of the tyrant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who had not the ſworde pendant ouer his moſt wicked head, but felt it alwaies ready braundiſhed in his wide woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded heart?</p>
               <p>But now what ſhall I ſay to the Satyricall Poet: <hi>Yea, but tell Prelates, what good golde dooth in a Temple?</hi> Albeit there is ſmall reaſon (that I may put in an anſwere for the prieſts of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then) why you of all other ſhould bee made priuie to this: yet notwithſtanding, thus much dare I ſaye in defence thereof, that that gold what-ſoeuer it was, was hollowed, euen vnto the moſt impious and idolatrous Prieſts. But for that which was kept in the Temple of GOD, wee may learne, by that which <hi>Onias</hi> the Hie-Prieſt ſaid to <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> what vſe it had: namely to releiue the poore widows, and maintaine the more needfull ophanes.</p>
               <p>And as for that which concerneth the treaſure of the Church, when it had anie, it was neither idle I aſſure you, nor euill occupied, but as occaſion ſerued it, it ſerued the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8306:142"/> neceſſities of the diſtreſſed: and wee may ſay with <hi>Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> The Church hath gold, not to lay vp, but to lay out. For that indeed, to feed the poore, releeue the needy, and defend the opreſſed, were the actions and exerciſes, for the which the BB. of old haue bene worthely commended. And to that end alſo, becauſe the chriſtian people, would haue BB. aboue all other to be bountiful, they did abundantly prouide, that they might ſo be with the beſt. But now this is the only drift of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in ſome, of ſimplicity in many, that by all means the ſtate of our BB. might be brought to begers eſtate: they may teach charity (good leaue haue they) and preach liberality, (there is no man againſt it) but practiſe it they maye not; they are not forbidden, but they are not allowed. I know they will obiect the auarice of fom, &amp; the riotouſnes of many BB. in the goods of the Church, that by one meanes or other, they imbecil that part, which of right pertaineth to the pore. But to admit, that the pore mans part were in the BB. purſe: (of the which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they haue had their <hi>quietus eſt</hi>) with what ſtrange reaſon, or with what new religion do they go about to excuſe ſacrilege with ſacrilege? as if the BB. error could qualifie their rage. But I perceiue, leaſt the Paſtors of the Church ſhould bee the onely ſacrilegers, they which haue got the church-goods into their hands, had rather bee found of both, the greater church-robbers. For who ſeeth not, that whatſoeuer is once ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken from the church vnder this colour, the poore neuer licke their lips after it? yea, the pore are in far worſe caſe at this day, then euer they were before; who haue found poore church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men more liberall of old, then they can finde rich gentlemen now, or any other, which at this day by wrong and robbery v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe the goods of the Church. The tyranny of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats being diſſolued, might not the pore more eaſily haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their due of the godly Paſtors, then of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which now haue crept into their poſſeſſions? But to concluded, I affirme, &amp; you ſhall find it true, that whoſoeuer they be, that wrongfully lurch the Church of their good, or by any meanes abuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let them bee of what title they may, or let them doe it vnder what title they will, they cannot bee excuſed of ſacrilege, nor their ſacrilege excuſed, when God ſhall viſit with a vengeance.</p>
